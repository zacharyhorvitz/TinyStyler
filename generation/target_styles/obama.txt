Good afternoon, everybody.
Let me start out by saying that I was sorely tempted to wear a tan suit today -- (laughter) -- for my last press conference.
But Michelle, whose fashion sense is a little better than mine, tells me that's not appropriate in January.
I covered a lot of the ground that I would want to cover in my farewell address last week.
So I'm just going to say a couple of quick things before I start taking questions.
First, we have been in touch with the Bush family today, after hearing about President George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush being admitted to the hospital this morning.
They have not only dedicated their lives to this country, they have been a constant source of friendship and support and good counsel for Michelle and me over the years.
They are as fine a couple as we know.  And so we want to send our prayers and our love to them.  Really good people.
Second thing I want to do is to thank all of you.
Some of you have been covering me for a long time -- folks like Christi and Win.
Some of you I've just gotten to know.  We have traveled the world together. 
We’ve hit a few singles, a few doubles together.
I’ve offered advice that I thought was pretty sound, like “don’t do stupid…stuff.”  (Laughter.)
And even when you complained about my long answers, I just want you to know that the only reason they were long was because you asked six-part questions.  (Laughter.)   
But I have enjoyed working with all of you.
That does not, of course, mean that I’ve enjoyed every story that you have filed.
But that’s the point of this relationship.
You’re not supposed to be sycophants, you're supposed to be skeptics.
You’re supposed to ask me tough questions.
You're not supposed to be complimentary, but you're supposed to cast a critical eye on folks who hold enormous power and make sure that we are accountable to the people who sent us here. 
And you have done that.
And you’ve done it, for the most part, in ways that I could appreciate for fairness even if I didn’t always agree with your conclusions.
And having you in this building has made this place work better.
It keeps us honest.
It makes us work harder.
It made us think about how we are doing what we do and whether or not we're able to deliver on what’s been requested by our constituents. 
And for example, every time you’ve asked “why haven’t you cured Ebola yet,” or “why is that still that hole in the Gulf,” it has given me the ability to go back to my team and say, “will you get this solved before the next press conference?”  (Laughter.)
