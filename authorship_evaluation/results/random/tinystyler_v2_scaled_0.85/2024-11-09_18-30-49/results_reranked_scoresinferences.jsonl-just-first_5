They had to go out and hire multiple different parties to work on the various pieces of the games that are constantly being developed (that we get constantly updated on).\n\nI'm not sure what you expect to surpass the scope of what they are aiming for, nothing even close has been announced and to have 3.0 here in 2017 which represents a first full iteration of the game essentially I doubt something will overcome that.\n\nNMS blew it, they're an inexperienced developer who fell to hype, but not like they care as they are rolling around in the money of pre-orders. Star Citizen was starting down this road but quickly fixed the ship, whenever they missed the initial deadlines and saw the community backlash they opted to not state any further 'release dates'.

And you're correct that states may not be more restrictive with that liberty. But they can certainly be more permissive. SCOTUS created a floor, not a ceiling. SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing. ", "\"They can't go more permissive then Congress\"\n\nBut, ostensibly, *Heller* threw congressional regulation up for review. ", "I'm aware of the supremacy clause. Ostensibly *Heller* put many of those federal regulations up for review, right? As such SCOTUS created a floor but no ceiling.  Many regulations must meet scrutiny now. Or am I wrong about that? \n\nYour logic would lead to results that could render the 2A meaningless. States have shown time and again that they cannot be trusted with minimum supervision. IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

You ask why you should bother. And I say because this is a debate forum.\n\nThat's not a good reason to bother. \n\n&gt; Just because there must be at least one thing that everything else is 'moved by' doesn't mean that all of those things are 'contained' in the first thing.\n\nIt does in this case. \n\n&gt; That's not an argument that is proven correct by my acceptance that a thing's existence can be explained by nothing. That's just an opinion that you happen to hold.\n\nAnd you objected, saying you believe something like the PSR. \n\n&gt; This again. Why are you pretending to have not seen the words that I have written?\n\nI'm not, I'm well aware of what you've written. \n\n&gt; \"I view 'Internal explanations' as an attempt to maintain that you haven't thrown out the principle of sufficient reason, when in reality that's exactly what you've done.\"\n\nThis view is very silly, but also entirely irrelevant. \n\n&gt; \" I think they're equivalent. Meaning I think \"internal causation\" actually means \"no causation\". Other people, like you, obviously do not share my view. You think that internal causation is somehow distinct from no causation.\"\n\nSo you accept that \"internal causation\" means \"no causation\" and \"no causation\" means \"internal causation\"?\n\nIn which case, you'd accept the claim \"Everything that exists either has an external explanation or an internal explanation\". \n\nWhich is the PSR. So now you accept the PSR. Hence the contradiction. ", "Then you need some more premises to justify the use of science.

In my experience, most Christians believe they *do* deserve hell. \n\n&gt; 3rd bullet point: The Bible states that sin is a transgression of the law, the Torah was the law, therefore, sin is breaking the Torah law, that is my argument\n\nYou didn't provide this justification earlier, and either way it's bad. It's not convincing. Because it's false. \n\n&gt; 2nd bullet point: in my opinion, not all people deserve death, why? I don't know, why do you think, it's my opinion, I have no argument other than this is my personal opinion\n\n&gt; 1st bullet point: also my personal opinion\n\nAnd why should I care at all about what your opinion is? Arguing isn't about informing people about your opinion. Arguing is about *justifying your views*. If you are incapable of justifying any view you have, you should not have it. If you are incapable of justifying these opinions, then you should abandon them. You have no reason to think they are true.\n\nSo it boils down to this: feelings are not good evidence.

That's a conditional claim. And it's true, *if* I believed that I'd accept the conclusion. \n\n&gt; You shouldn't care about what my opinion is. However, when arguing religion, something that can't be proven,\n\nNow here's the issue. I hold that claims about religion *can* be proven. Obviously. If I didn't believe that, why would I hold any opinions about religion?\n\n&gt; But so far every single time I state my belief and why I believe it, you literally just say \"you didn't justify it.\" How else can I justify my beliefs without explaining them? Explaining my beliefs is justifying them\n\nNo, it is not. I could go into extravagant detail about how the Earth is hollow and Nazis live there who are planning on destroying the moon, but explaining *what* I believe doesn't get us any closer to those beliefs being justified.\n\nI understand *what* you believe, I just don't think there's any good reason to believe it. And you haven't given one. \n\n&gt;  I'm done with this argument because it is literally going nowhere, it's literally just me explaining my beliefs, and you going \"justify them\" than me trying to justify them, and then you ignoring what I said by saying \"don't explain, justify\" without realizing I can't justify without explaining my beliefs.\n\nYou've explained your beliefs plenty.

You ask why you should bother. And I say because this is a debate forum.\n\nThat's not a good reason to bother. \n\n&gt; Just because there must be at least one thing that everything else is 'moved by' doesn't mean that all of those things are 'contained' in the first thing.\n\nIt does in this case. \n\n&gt; That's not an argument that is proven correct by my acceptance that a thing's existence can be explained by nothing. That's just an opinion that you happen to hold.\n\nAnd you objected, saying you believe something like the PSR. \n\n&gt; This again. Why are you pretending to have not seen the words that I have written?\n\nI'm not, I'm well aware of what you've written. \n\n&gt; \"I view 'Internal explanations' as an attempt to maintain that you haven't thrown out the principle of sufficient reason, when in reality that's exactly what you've done.\"\n\nThis view is very silly, but also entirely irrelevant. \n\n&gt; \" I think they're equivalent. Meaning I think \"internal causation\" actually means \"no causation\". Other people, like you, obviously do not share my view. You think that internal causation is somehow distinct from no causation.\"\n\nSo you accept that \"internal causation\" means \"no causation\" and \"no causation\" means \"internal causation\"?\n\nIn which case, you'd accept the claim \"Everything that exists either has an external explanation or an internal explanation\". \n\nWhich is the PSR. So now you accept the PSR. Hence the contradiction. ", "Then you need some more premises to justify the use of science.

And  you didn't respond to my objection. \n\n&gt; 4th bullet point: I am assuming most people do not think they deserve in eternity in agonizing torment for finite sins, that is my argument\n\nWhy should I care what most people think? In my experience, most Christians believe they *do* deserve hell. \n\n&gt; 3rd bullet point: The Bible states that sin is a transgression of the law, the Torah was the law, therefore, sin is breaking the Torah law, that is my argument\n\nYou didn't provide this justification earlier, and either way it's bad. It's not convincing. Because it's false. \n\n&gt; 2nd bullet point: in my opinion, not all people deserve death, why? I don't know, why do you think, it's my opinion, I have no argument other than this is my personal opinion\n\n&gt; 1st bullet point: also my personal opinion\n\nAnd why should I care at all about what your opinion is? Arguing isn't about informing people about your opinion. Arguing is about *justifying your views*. If you are incapable of justifying any view you have, you should not have it. If you are incapable of justifying these opinions, then you should abandon them. You have no reason to think they are true.\n\nSo it boils down to this: feelings are not good evidence. You need real justification for your belief. \n\nOr I guess you can just not care if you're wrong. I can't make you care about that. ", "So you don't believe science is a good way of learning about the universe?", "&gt; Where is your justification for anything you just said? \n\nI don't feel the need to provide any when you haven't. I don't have to prove the opposite of what you're saying, all I have to do is point out you haven't justified your claims. What has been presented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. \n\n&gt; I said before \"if you believe in the Bible, and you believe that a sin is a transgression of the law, and if you believe God gave the law to Moses, and if you don't follow the Torah, you are a sinner because you are breaking the law\" \n\nThat's a very different claim. That's a conditional claim. And it's true, *if* I believed that I'd accept the conclusion. \n\n&gt; You shouldn't care about what my opinion is. However, when arguing religion, something that can't be proven,\n\nNow here's the issue. I hold that claims about religion *can* be proven. Obviously. If I didn't believe that, why would I hold any opinions about religion?\n\n&gt; But so far every single time I state my belief and why I believe it, you literally just say \"you didn't justify it.\" How else can I justify my beliefs without explaining them? Explaining my beliefs is justifying them\n\nNo, it is not. I could go into extravagant detail about how the Earth is hollow and Nazis live there who are planning on destroying the moon, but explaining *what* I believe doesn't get us any closer to those beliefs being justified.\n\nI understand *what* you believe, I just don't think there's any good reason to believe it. And you haven't given one. \n\n&gt;  I'm done with this argument because it is literally going nowhere, it's literally just me explaining my beliefs, and you going \"justify them\" than me trying to justify them, and then you ignoring what I said by saying \"don't explain, justify\" without realizing I can't justify without explaining my beliefs.\n\nYou've explained your beliefs plenty. I understand  them. That is not the issue. The issue is that I do not agree. Which means you need to justify.

You ask why you should bother.

That's just an opinion that you happen to hold.\n\nAnd you objected, saying you believe something like the PSR. \n\n&gt; This again. Why are you pretending to have not seen the words that I have written?\n\nI'm not, I'm well aware of what you've written. \n\n&gt; \"I view 'Internal explanations' as an attempt to maintain that you haven't thrown out the principle of sufficient reason, when in reality that's exactly what you've done.\"\n\nThis view is very silly, but also entirely irrelevant. \n\n&gt; \" I think they're equivalent. Meaning I think \"internal causation\" actually means \"no causation\". Other people, like you, obviously do not share my view. You think that internal causation is somehow distinct from no causation.\"\n\nSo you accept that \"internal causation\" means \"no causation\" and \"no causation\" means \"internal causation\"?\n\nIn which case, you'd accept the claim \"Everything that exists either has an external explanation or an internal explanation\". \n\nWhich is the PSR. So now you accept the PSR. Hence the contradiction. ", "Then you need some more premises to justify the use of science.

In my experience, most Christians believe they *do* deserve hell. \n\n&gt; 3rd bullet point: The Bible states that sin is a transgression of the law, the Torah was the law, therefore, sin is breaking the Torah law, that is my argument\n\nYou didn't provide this justification earlier, and either way it's bad. It's not convincing. Because it's false. \n\n&gt; 2nd bullet point: in my opinion, not all people deserve death, why? I don't know, why do you think, it's my opinion, I have no argument other than this is my personal opinion\n\n&gt; 1st bullet point: also my personal opinion\n\nAnd why should I care at all about what your opinion is? Arguing isn't about informing people about your opinion. Arguing is about *justifying your views*. If you are incapable of justifying any view you have, you should not have it. If you are incapable of justifying these opinions, then you should abandon them. You have no reason to think they are true.\n\nSo it boils down to this: feelings are not good evidence. You need real justification for your belief. \n\nOr I guess you can just not care if you're wrong. I can't make you care about that. ", "So you don't believe science is a good way of learning about the universe?", "&gt; Where is your justification for anything you just said? \n\nI don't feel the need to provide any when you haven't. I don't have to prove the opposite of what you're saying, all I have to do is point out you haven't justified your claims. What has been presented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. \n\n&gt; I said before \"if you believe in the Bible, and you believe that a sin is a transgression of the law, and if you believe God gave the law to Moses, and if you don't follow the Torah, you are a sinner because you are breaking the law\" \n\nThat's a very different claim. That's a conditional claim. And it's true, *if* I believed that I'd accept the conclusion. \n\n&gt; You shouldn't care about what my opinion is. However, when arguing religion, something that can't be proven,\n\nNow here's the issue. I hold that claims about religion *can* be proven. Obviously. If I didn't believe that, why would I hold any opinions about religion?\n\n&gt; But so far every single time I state my belief and why I believe it, you literally just say \"you didn't justify it.\" How else can I justify my beliefs without explaining them? Explaining my beliefs is justifying them\n\nNo, it is not. I could go into extravagant detail about how the Earth is hollow and Nazis live there who are planning on destroying the moon, but explaining *what* I believe doesn't get us any closer to those beliefs being justified.\n\nI understand *what* you believe, I just don't think there's any good reason to believe it. And you haven't given one. \n\n&gt;  I'm done with this argument because it is literally going nowhere, it's literally just me explaining my beliefs, and you going \"justify them\" than me trying to justify them, and then you ignoring what I said by saying \"don't explain, justify\" without realizing I can't justify without explaining my beliefs.\n\nYou've explained your beliefs plenty. I understand  them. That is not the issue. The issue is that I do not agree. Which means you need to justify.

Meaning I think \"internal causation\" actually means \"no causation\". Other people, like you, obviously do not share my view.

Explaining my beliefs is justifying them\n\nNo, it is not. I could go into extravagant detail about how the Earth is hollow and Nazis live there who are planning on destroying the moon, but explaining *what* I believe doesn't get us any closer to those beliefs being justified.\n\nI understand *what* you believe, I just don't think there's any good reason to believe it.

And you're correct that states may not be more restrictive with that liberty. But they can certainly be more permissive. SCOTUS created a floor, not a ceiling. SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

This is an assertion.\n\nSo now you think the Prime Mover has accidental properties?\n\n&gt; Yeah and then I ask why rejecting the most basic premises would stop you from giving me the latter premises. You ask why you should bother. And I say because this is a debate forum.\n\nThat's not a good reason to bother. \n\n&gt; Just because there must be at least one thing that everything else is 'moved by' doesn't mean that all of those things are 'contained' in the first thing.\n\nIt does in this case. \n\n&gt; That's not an argument that is proven correct by my acceptance that a thing's existence can be explained by nothing. That's just an opinion that you happen to hold.\n\nAnd you objected, saying you believe something like the PSR. \n\n&gt; This again. Why are you pretending to have not seen the words that I have written?\n\nI'm not, I'm well aware of what you've written. \n\n&gt; \"I view 'Internal explanations' as an attempt to maintain that you haven't thrown out the principle of sufficient reason, when in reality that's exactly what you've done.\"\n\nThis view is very silly, but also entirely irrelevant. \n\n&gt; \" I think they're equivalent. Meaning I think \"internal causation\" actually means \"no causation\". Other people, like you, obviously do not share my view. You think that internal causation is somehow distinct from no causation.\"\n\nSo you accept that \"internal causation\" means \"no causation\" and \"no causation\" means \"internal causation\"?\n\nIn which case, you'd accept the claim \"Everything that exists either has an external explanation or an internal explanation\". \n\nWhich is the PSR. So now you accept the PSR. Hence the contradiction. ", "Then you need some more premises to justify the use of science. It doesn't follow from your premises that science is a good way to learn about the universe. ", "&gt; 5th bullet point: I said by saying this we place limits on God, that was my argument.\n\nThat's your *claim*. Not a justification. And  you didn't respond to my objection. \n\n&gt; 4th bullet point: I am assuming most people do not think they deserve in eternity in agonizing torment for finite sins, that is my argument\n\nWhy should I care what most people think? In my experience, most Christians believe they *do* deserve hell. \n\n&gt; 3rd bullet point: The Bible states that sin is a transgression of the law, the Torah was the law, therefore, sin is breaking the Torah law, that is my argument\n\nYou didn't provide this justification earlier, and either way it's bad. It's not convincing. Because it's false. \n\n&gt; 2nd bullet point: in my opinion, not all people deserve death, why? I don't know, why do you think, it's my opinion, I have no argument other than this is my personal opinion\n\n&gt; 1st bullet point: also my personal opinion\n\nAnd why should I care at all about what your opinion is? Arguing isn't about informing people about your opinion. Arguing is about *justifying your views*. If you are incapable of justifying any view you have, you should not have it. If you are incapable of justifying these opinions, then you should abandon them. You have no reason to think they are true.\n\nSo it boils down to this: feelings are not good evidence. You need real justification for your belief. \n\nOr I guess you can just not care if you're wrong. I can't make you care about that.

I don't have to prove the opposite of what you're saying, all I have to do is point out you haven't justified your claims. What has been presented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. \n\n&gt; I said before \"if you believe in the Bible, and you believe that a sin is a transgression of the law, and if you believe God gave the law to Moses, and if you don't follow the Torah, you are a sinner because you are breaking the law\" \n\nThat's a very different claim. That's a conditional claim. And it's true, *if* I believed that I'd accept the conclusion. \n\n&gt; You shouldn't care about what my opinion is. However, when arguing religion, something that can't be proven,\n\nNow here's the issue. I hold that claims about religion *can* be proven. Obviously. If I didn't believe that, why would I hold any opinions about religion?\n\n&gt; But so far every single time I state my belief and why I believe it, you literally just say \"you didn't justify it.\" How else can I justify my beliefs without explaining them? Explaining my beliefs is justifying them\n\nNo, it is not. I could go into extravagant detail about how the Earth is hollow and Nazis live there who are planning on destroying the moon, but explaining *what* I believe doesn't get us any closer to those beliefs being justified.\n\nI understand *what* you believe, I just don't think there's any good reason to believe it. And you haven't given one. \n\n&gt;  I'm done with this argument because it is literally going nowhere, it's literally just me explaining my beliefs, and you going \"justify them\" than me trying to justify them, and then you ignoring what I said by saying \"don't explain, justify\" without realizing I can't justify without explaining my beliefs.\n\nYou've explained your beliefs plenty. I understand  them. That is not the issue. The issue is that I do not agree. Which means you need to justify.

Meaning I think \"internal causation\" actually means \"no causation\". Other people, like you, obviously do not share my view. You think that internal causation is somehow distinct from no causation.\"\n\nSo you accept that \"internal causation\" means \"no causation\" and \"no causation\" means \"internal causation\"?\n\nIn which case, you'd accept the claim \"Everything that exists either has an external explanation or an internal explanation\". \n\nWhich is the PSR.

I don't know, why do you think, it's my opinion, I have no argument other than this is my personal opinion\n\n&gt; 1st bullet point: also my personal opinion\n\nAnd why should I care at all about what your opinion is? Arguing isn't about informing people about your opinion. Arguing is about *justifying your views*. If you are incapable of justifying any view you have, you should not have it. If you are incapable of justifying these opinions, then you should abandon them. You have no reason to think they are true.\n\nSo it boils down to this: feelings are not good evidence.

I don't have to prove the opposite of what you're saying, all I have to do is point out you haven't justified your claims. What has been presented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. \n\n&gt; I said before \"if you believe in the Bible, and you believe that a sin is a transgression of the law, and if you believe God gave the law to Moses, and if you don't follow the Torah, you are a sinner because you are breaking the law\" \n\nThat's a very different claim. That's a conditional claim. And it's true, *if* I believed that I'd accept the conclusion. \n\n&gt; You shouldn't care about what my opinion is. However, when arguing religion, something that can't be proven,\n\nNow here's the issue. I hold that claims about religion *can* be proven. Obviously. If I didn't believe that, why would I hold any opinions about religion?\n\n&gt; But so far every single time I state my belief and why I believe it, you literally just say \"you didn't justify it.\" How else can I justify my beliefs without explaining them? Explaining my beliefs is justifying them\n\nNo, it is not. I could go into extravagant detail about how the Earth is hollow and Nazis live there who are planning on destroying the moon, but explaining *what* I believe doesn't get us any closer to those beliefs being justified.\n\nI understand *what* you believe, I just don't think there's any good reason to believe it. And you haven't given one. \n\n&gt;  I'm done with this argument because it is literally going nowhere, it's literally just me explaining my beliefs, and you going \"justify them\" than me trying to justify them, and then you ignoring what I said by saying \"don't explain, justify\" without realizing I can't justify without explaining my beliefs.\n\nYou've explained your beliefs plenty.

This is an assertion.\n\nSo now you think the Prime Mover has accidental properties?\n\n&gt; Yeah and then I ask why rejecting the most basic premises would stop you from giving me the latter premises. You ask why you should bother. And I say because this is a debate forum.\n\nThat's not a good reason to bother. \n\n&gt; Just because there must be at least one thing that everything else is 'moved by' doesn't mean that all of those things are 'contained' in the first thing.\n\nIt does in this case. \n\n&gt; That's not an argument that is proven correct by my acceptance that a thing's existence can be explained by nothing. That's just an opinion that you happen to hold.\n\nAnd you objected, saying you believe something like the PSR. \n\n&gt; This again. Why are you pretending to have not seen the words that I have written?\n\nI'm not, I'm well aware of what you've written. \n\n&gt; \"I view 'Internal explanations' as an attempt to maintain that you haven't thrown out the principle of sufficient reason, when in reality that's exactly what you've done.\"\n\nThis view is very silly, but also entirely irrelevant. \n\n&gt; \" I think they're equivalent. Meaning I think \"internal causation\" actually means \"no causation\". Other people, like you, obviously do not share my view. You think that internal causation is somehow distinct from no causation.\"\n\nSo you accept that \"internal causation\" means \"no causation\" and \"no causation\" means \"internal causation\"?\n\nIn which case, you'd accept the claim \"Everything that exists either has an external explanation or an internal explanation\". \n\nWhich is the PSR. So now you accept the PSR. Hence the contradiction. ", "Then you need some more premises to justify the use of science. It doesn't follow from your premises that science is a good way to learn about the universe. ", "&gt; 5th bullet point: I said by saying this we place limits on God, that was my argument.\n\nThat's your *claim*. Not a justification. And  you didn't respond to my objection. \n\n&gt; 4th bullet point: I am assuming most people do not think they deserve in eternity in agonizing torment for finite sins, that is my argument\n\nWhy should I care what most people think? In my experience, most Christians believe they *do* deserve hell. \n\n&gt; 3rd bullet point: The Bible states that sin is a transgression of the law, the Torah was the law, therefore, sin is breaking the Torah law, that is my argument\n\nYou didn't provide this justification earlier, and either way it's bad. It's not convincing. Because it's false. \n\n&gt; 2nd bullet point: in my opinion, not all people deserve death, why? I don't know, why do you think, it's my opinion, I have no argument other than this is my personal opinion\n\n&gt; 1st bullet point: also my personal opinion\n\nAnd why should I care at all about what your opinion is? Arguing isn't about informing people about your opinion. Arguing is about *justifying your views*. If you are incapable of justifying any view you have, you should not have it. If you are incapable of justifying these opinions, then you should abandon them. You have no reason to think they are true.\n\nSo it boils down to this: feelings are not good evidence. You need real justification for your belief. \n\nOr I guess you can just not care if you're wrong. I can't make you care about that. ", "So you don't believe science is a good way of learning about the universe?", "&gt; Where is your justification for anything you just said? \n\nI don't feel the need to provide any when you haven't. I don't have to prove the opposite of what you're saying, all I have to do is point out you haven't justified your claims. What has been presented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. \n\n&gt; I said before \"if you believe in the Bible, and you believe that a sin is a transgression of the law, and if you believe God gave the law to Moses, and if you don't follow the Torah, you are a sinner because you are breaking the law\" \n\nThat's a very different claim. That's a conditional claim. And it's true, *if* I believed that I'd accept the conclusion. \n\n&gt; You shouldn't care about what my opinion is. However, when arguing religion, something that can't be proven,\n\nNow here's the issue. I hold that claims about religion *can* be proven. Obviously. If I didn't believe that, why would I hold any opinions about religion?\n\n&gt; But so far every single time I state my belief and why I believe it, you literally just say \"you didn't justify it.\" How else can I justify my beliefs without explaining them? Explaining my beliefs is justifying them\n\nNo, it is not. I could go into extravagant detail about how the Earth is hollow and Nazis live there who are planning on destroying the moon, but explaining *what* I believe doesn't get us any closer to those beliefs being justified.\n\nI understand *what* you believe, I just don't think there's any good reason to believe it. And you haven't given one. \n\n&gt;  I'm done with this argument because it is literally going nowhere, it's literally just me explaining my beliefs, and you going \"justify them\" than me trying to justify them, and then you ignoring what I said by saying \"don't explain, justify\" without realizing I can't justify without explaining my beliefs.\n\nYou've explained your beliefs plenty. I understand  them. That is not the issue. The issue is that I do not agree. Which means you need to justify. Sure, you can't justify without explaining to some degree, but you've done the explaining and you haven't done the justifying.

You ask why you should bother. And I say because this is a debate forum.\n\nThat's not a good reason to bother. \n\n&gt; Just because there must be at least one thing that everything else is 'moved by' doesn't mean that all of those things are 'contained' in the first thing.\n\nIt does in this case. \n\n&gt; That's not an argument that is proven correct by my acceptance that a thing's existence can be explained by nothing. That's just an opinion that you happen to hold.\n\nAnd you objected, saying you believe something like the PSR. \n\n&gt; This again. Why are you pretending to have not seen the words that I have written?\n\nI'm not, I'm well aware of what you've written. \n\n&gt; \"I view 'Internal explanations' as an attempt to maintain that you haven't thrown out the principle of sufficient reason, when in reality that's exactly what you've done.\"\n\nThis view is very silly, but also entirely irrelevant. \n\n&gt; \" I think they're equivalent. Meaning I think \"internal causation\" actually means \"no causation\". Other people, like you, obviously do not share my view. You think that internal causation is somehow distinct from no causation.\"\n\nSo you accept that \"internal causation\" means \"no causation\" and \"no causation\" means \"internal causation\"?\n\nIn which case, you'd accept the claim \"Everything that exists either has an external explanation or an internal explanation\". \n\nWhich is the PSR. So now you accept the PSR. Hence the contradiction. ", "Then you need some more premises to justify the use of science. It doesn't follow from your premises that science is a good way to learn about the universe. ", "&gt; 5th bullet point: I said by saying this we place limits on God, that was my argument.\n\nThat's your *claim*. Not a justification. And  you didn't respond to my objection. \n\n&gt; 4th bullet point: I am assuming most people do not think they deserve in eternity in agonizing torment for finite sins, that is my argument\n\nWhy should I care what most people think? In my experience, most Christians believe they *do* deserve hell. \n\n&gt; 3rd bullet point: The Bible states that sin is a transgression of the law, the Torah was the law, therefore, sin is breaking the Torah law, that is my argument\n\nYou didn't provide this justification earlier, and either way it's bad. It's not convincing. Because it's false. \n\n&gt; 2nd bullet point: in my opinion, not all people deserve death, why? I don't know, why do you think, it's my opinion, I have no argument other than this is my personal opinion\n\n&gt; 1st bullet point: also my personal opinion\n\nAnd why should I care at all about what your opinion is? Arguing isn't about informing people about your opinion. Arguing is about *justifying your views*. If you are incapable of justifying any view you have, you should not have it. If you are incapable of justifying these opinions, then you should abandon them. You have no reason to think they are true.\n\nSo it boils down to this: feelings are not good evidence. You need real justification for your belief. \n\nOr I guess you can just not care if you're wrong. I can't make you care about that. ", "So you don't believe science is a good way of learning about the universe?", "&gt; Where is your justification for anything you just said? \n\nI don't feel the need to provide any when you haven't. I don't have to prove the opposite of what you're saying, all I have to do is point out you haven't justified your claims. What has been presented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. \n\n&gt; I said before \"if you believe in the Bible, and you believe that a sin is a transgression of the law, and if you believe God gave the law to Moses, and if you don't follow the Torah, you are a sinner because you are breaking the law\" \n\nThat's a very different claim. That's a conditional claim. And it's true, *if* I believed that I'd accept the conclusion. \n\n&gt; You shouldn't care about what my opinion is. However, when arguing religion, something that can't be proven,\n\nNow here's the issue. I hold that claims about religion *can* be proven. Obviously. If I didn't believe that, why would I hold any opinions about religion?\n\n&gt; But so far every single time I state my belief and why I believe it, you literally just say \"you didn't justify it.\" How else can I justify my beliefs without explaining them? Explaining my beliefs is justifying them\n\nNo, it is not. I could go into extravagant detail about how the Earth is hollow and Nazis live there who are planning on destroying the moon, but explaining *what* I believe doesn't get us any closer to those beliefs being justified.\n\nI understand *what* you believe, I just don't think there's any good reason to believe it. And you haven't given one. \n\n&gt;  I'm done with this argument because it is literally going nowhere, it's literally just me explaining my beliefs, and you going \"justify them\" than me trying to justify them, and then you ignoring what I said by saying \"don't explain, justify\" without realizing I can't justify without explaining my beliefs.\n\nYou've explained your beliefs plenty. I understand  them. That is not the issue. The issue is that I do not agree. Which means you need to justify. Sure, you can't justify without explaining to some degree, but you've done the explaining and you haven't done the justifying.

So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

And you're correct that states may not be more restrictive with that liberty. But they can certainly be more permissive. SCOTUS created a floor, not a ceiling. SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing.

Or am I wrong about that? \n\nYour logic would lead to results that could render the 2A meaningless. States have shown time and again that they cannot be trusted with minimum supervision. IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

Thresh has more potential.\n\nAlistar too yes, but I dont see him much in low elo. He can be a nuinsance when paired with a premade, but his engage is very short ranged. Eversince his nerf (which was before me started playing) , hes not as popular(?) , I think. This is based one me reading past guides.\n\nTaric has been solid since his rework. Sure his dps is lower now but hes good at keeping your ADC alive.. I love playing him with Twitch. Twitch can proc his Q stun while hes in stealth. Lmao. His W and E procs Windspeaker while most utility supports has only 1 skill to proc Windspeakers Blessing.\n\nSupport Sion has high win rate.  Good engager (in bush+ Q)\n\nTldr; Leona is the easiest to use in lower elo. Recommended ! Freelo champ. Taric is really good too, hes just.. boring to use"], "transferred_texts": [["Your best bet is a mask and snorkel.

But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing. ", "\"They can't go more permissive then Congress\"\n\nBut, ostensibly, *Heller* threw congressional regulation up for review. ", "I'm aware of the supremacy clause. Ostensibly *Heller* put many of those federal regulations up for review, right? As such SCOTUS created a floor but no ceiling.  Many regulations must meet scrutiny now. Or am I wrong about that? \n\nYour logic would lead to results that could render the 2A meaningless. States have shown time and again that they cannot be trusted with minimum supervision. IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.  But the complications between state and federal law in this area is dangerous to the average person. Amd I think we all deserve some simplicity and minimal standardization here.\n\nEdit.

She'll help you a lot to understand the game mechanics.\n\nMost of the time specific guide of a certain champion includes tips on how to tf/ solo-botlaning with the champ.\n\nFor eg, if u wanna main Soraka (imo Janna is better for beginner because it trains ur decision making better), just look for a Soraka guide. Under skill description/upgrades, posters sometimes tell readers how to use it.\n\nSubscribing to  the champions main subreddit also helps.  I just started playing 4 months ago, and 1 month in I looked into  r/Karmamains and r/Jannamains and it helps me a lot.  Other mains post some of their impressive play and u can try to copy it.\n\nAs for team fight; \n\n1. Keep your adc alive\n\n2. Dont frontline when yr using non-tank supps like Raka. You need to stay far from the enemy. Only E when u feel like u need to. \n\n3. If ur a tank supp, u must engage the enemy carry (ADC most of the time) and after that focus on keeping ur adc alive.\n\n4. In 2v2 botlane fight. If say youre playing Bard against a Thresh. And Thresh manages to hook ur ADC and does his QE combo, u might wanna W ur ADC and proceed to Q-ing and AA the enemy ADC, NOT the enemy support. This one,  I took a loong looong time to realize. I realize sometimes disenaging your ADC from enemys supp might not be as efficient as procceeding to CC-ing the enemys ADC instead, even if the enemy supp has significantly lower hp than the enemy ADC.", "I been telling yall bitches; Cutthroat, worse-than-fucking-prison Drag Queens in a fucking competition &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; RuPauls Best Friends Race.

Also I dont know your rank, but I guess you can draw an extrapolation if youre better at the game.\n\n1.Most supports can engage , heck even Janna can although shes more of a peeler. Ayways tank supports are the traditional good engagers. The one I hate fighting the most is Leona..... fuck Leona.. fuck Leona.. fuck Leona.. her level 1 powerspike + ignite is stupid. Nautilus is kinda similar.\n\nThresh has been consistently good eventho there has been so many patches. So he gets the honorable mention. Blitzcranks is kinda similar.. Thresh has more potential.\n\nAlistar too yes, but I dont see him much in low elo. He can be a nuinsance when paired with a premade, but his engage is very short ranged. Eversince his nerf (which was before me started playing) , hes not as popular(?) , I think. This is based one me reading past guides.\n\nTaric has been solid since his rework. Sure his dps is lower now but hes good at keeping your ADC alive.. I love playing him with Twitch. Twitch can proc his Q stun while hes in stealth. Lmao. His W and E procs Windspeaker while most utility supports has only 1 skill to proc Windspeakers Blessing.\n\nSupport Sion has high win rate.  Good engager (in bush+ Q)\n\nTldr; Leona is the easiest to use in lower elo. Recommended ! Freelo champ.

SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

And you're correct that states may not be more restrictive with that liberty. But they can certainly be more permissive. SCOTUS created a floor, not a ceiling. SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing. ", "\"They can't go more permissive then Congress\"\n\nBut, ostensibly, *Heller* threw congressional regulation up for review. ", "I'm aware of the supremacy clause. Ostensibly *Heller* put many of those federal regulations up for review, right? As such SCOTUS created a floor but no ceiling.  Many regulations must meet scrutiny now. Or am I wrong about that? \n\nYour logic would lead to results that could render the 2A meaningless. States have shown time and again that they cannot be trusted with minimum supervision. IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.  But the complications between state and federal law in this area is dangerous to the average person. Amd I think we all deserve some simplicity and minimal standardization here.\n\nEdit.

I just started playing 4 months ago, and 1 month in I looked into  r/Karmamains and r/Jannamains and it helps me a lot.  Other mains post some of their impressive play and u can try to copy it.\n\nAs for team fight; \n\n1. Keep your adc alive\n\n2. Dont frontline when yr using non-tank supps like Raka. You need to stay far from the enemy. Only E when u feel like u need to. \n\n3. If ur a tank supp, u must engage the enemy carry (ADC most of the time) and after that focus on keeping ur adc alive.\n\n4. In 2v2 botlane fight. If say youre playing Bard against a Thresh. And Thresh manages to hook ur ADC and does his QE combo, u might wanna W ur ADC and proceed to Q-ing and AA the enemy ADC, NOT the enemy support. This one,  I took a loong looong time to realize. I realize sometimes disenaging your ADC from enemys supp might not be as efficient as procceeding to CC-ing the enemys ADC instead, even if the enemy supp has significantly lower hp than the enemy ADC.", "I been telling yall bitches; Cutthroat, worse-than-fucking-prison Drag Queens in a fucking competition &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; RuPauls Best Friends Race. Season 8 was mediocre and less memorable for the lack of drama. I love all the cast but it doesnt mean Season 8 made good tv. Season 7 was a GREAT TV SHOW. \n\nWe fucking need Villains edit. Period.\n\nAlso Im sory Phi Phi. I am a huge fan of yours but Im okay with your edit &gt;.&lt;  Nevertheless, I wont consider these villanous queens lesser", "Im still new so I dont have the deepest knowledge. Also I dont know your rank, but I guess you can draw an extrapolation if youre better at the game.\n\n1.Most supports can engage , heck even Janna can although shes more of a peeler. Ayways tank supports are the traditional good engagers. The one I hate fighting the most is Leona..... fuck Leona.. fuck Leona.. fuck Leona.. her level 1 powerspike + ignite is stupid. Nautilus is kinda similar.\n\nThresh has been consistently good eventho there has been so many patches. So he gets the honorable mention. Blitzcranks is kinda similar.. Thresh has more potential.\n\nAlistar too yes, but I dont see him much in low elo. He can be a nuinsance when paired with a premade, but his engage is very short ranged. Eversince his nerf (which was before me started playing) , hes not as popular(?) , I think. This is based one me reading past guides.\n\nTaric has been solid since his rework. Sure his dps is lower now but hes good at keeping your ADC alive.. I love playing him with Twitch. Twitch can proc his Q stun while hes in stealth. Lmao. His W and E procs Windspeaker while most utility supports has only 1 skill to proc Windspeakers Blessing.\n\nSupport Sion has high win rate.  Good engager (in bush+ Q)\n\nTldr; Leona is the easiest to use in lower elo. Recommended ! Freelo champ. Taric is really good too, hes just.. boring to use"], "transferred_texts": [["It forgets how to talk to the server. Have to force close and restart it several times a day.

SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing.

Or am I wrong about that? \n\nYour logic would lead to results that could render the 2A meaningless. States have shown time and again that they cannot be trusted with minimum supervision. IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

", "'Inequality is a feature, not a bug.' \n\nThis guy is a piece of shit. The opposite of economic inequality is economic equity, not equality. The complaint most people have is that we need more *equity* between the rich and the poor. Meaning, we want gains in proportion to those at the top - not necessarily the same as those at the top. \n\nAnd I want more freedom to determine my quality of life in a way that is not connected to a standard of living. But I don't want to live in perpetual crises and anxiety because I made that choice. He cites flat screen TVs and other crap as evidence that inequality 'works.' But this is tone deaf, and misleading. The anger here is that not only do I have to work more for less. But also that I can neither enjoy a higher standard of living *or* a better quality of life despite working just as much, or more. This is a breach of the most basic contract between politics and the social classes. And wealth inequality is one of the reasons why.\n", "His father is an interesting example of cognitive dissonance. And the relationship with the financial adviser was...strange.

And you're correct that states may not be more restrictive with that liberty. But they can certainly be more permissive. SCOTUS created a floor, not a ceiling. SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing. ", "\"They can't go more permissive then Congress\"\n\nBut, ostensibly, *Heller* threw congressional regulation up for review. ", "I'm aware of the supremacy clause. Ostensibly *Heller* put many of those federal regulations up for review, right? As such SCOTUS created a floor but no ceiling.  Many regulations must meet scrutiny now. Or am I wrong about that? \n\nYour logic would lead to results that could render the 2A meaningless. States have shown time and again that they cannot be trusted with minimum supervision. IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.  But the complications between state and federal law in this area is dangerous to the average person. Amd I think we all deserve some simplicity and minimal standardization here.\n\nEdit.

Other mains post some of their impressive play and u can try to copy it.\n\nAs for team fight; \n\n1. Keep your adc alive\n\n2. Dont frontline when yr using non-tank supps like Raka. You need to stay far from the enemy. Only E when u feel like u need to. \n\n3. If ur a tank supp, u must engage the enemy carry (ADC most of the time) and after that focus on keeping ur adc alive.\n\n4. In 2v2 botlane fight. If say youre playing Bard against a Thresh. And Thresh manages to hook ur ADC and does his QE combo, u might wanna W ur ADC and proceed to Q-ing and AA the enemy ADC, NOT the enemy support. This one,  I took a loong looong time to realize. I realize sometimes disenaging your ADC from enemys supp might not be as efficient as procceeding to CC-ing the enemys ADC instead, even if the enemy supp has significantly lower hp than the enemy ADC.", "I been telling yall bitches; Cutthroat, worse-than-fucking-prison Drag Queens in a fucking competition &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; RuPauls Best Friends Race.

Nautilus is kinda similar.\n\nThresh has been consistently good eventho there has been so many patches. So he gets the honorable mention. Blitzcranks is kinda similar.. Thresh has more potential.\n\nAlistar too yes, but I dont see him much in low elo. He can be a nuinsance when paired with a premade, but his engage is very short ranged. Eversince his nerf (which was before me started playing) , hes not as popular(?) , I think. This is based one me reading past guides.\n\nTaric has been solid since his rework. Sure his dps is lower now but hes good at keeping your ADC alive.. I love playing him with Twitch. Twitch can proc his Q stun while hes in stealth. Lmao. His W and E procs Windspeaker while most utility supports has only 1 skill to proc Windspeakers Blessing.\n\nSupport Sion has high win rate.  Good engager (in bush+ Q)\n\nTldr; Leona is the easiest to use in lower elo. Recommended ! Freelo champ.

SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

And you're correct that states may not be more restrictive with that liberty. But they can certainly be more permissive. SCOTUS created a floor, not a ceiling. SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing.

Ostensibly *Heller* put many of those federal regulations up for review, right? As such SCOTUS created a floor but no ceiling.  Many regulations must meet scrutiny now. Or am I wrong about that? \n\nYour logic would lead to results that could render the 2A meaningless. States have shown time and again that they cannot be trusted with minimum supervision. IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.
