They absolutely do it right and I'm not putting them down but Star Citizen started as a kickstarter with reasonable (while still ambitious) expectations that quickly grew into something much bigger than originally intended. They had to go out and hire multiple different parties to work on the various pieces of the games that are constantly being developed (that we get constantly updated on).\n\nI'm not sure what you expect to surpass the scope of what they are aiming for, nothing even close has been announced and to have 3.0 here in 2017 which represents a first full iteration of the game essentially I doubt something will overcome that.\n\nNMS blew it, they're an inexperienced developer who fell to hype, but not like they care as they are rolling around in the money of pre-orders. Star Citizen was starting down this road but quickly fixed the ship, whenever they missed the initial deadlines and saw the community backlash they opted to not state any further 'release dates'. Sure we may get general time frames but they've chosen to take their time so everything is properly done and obviously the community has accepted that as it keeps growing and the funds continue to pile up.\n\nCould it all turn out too good to be true? Sure, every game runs that risk. But considering the amount of transparency they provide from pretty much every single group working on the game it is quite clear they are building the game we all want and envisioned. In the end all we can do is wait and see. 5 Years of development is perfectly reasonable for a game such as this and I wouldn't even mind 2 more for it to be fully completed.", "RemindMe! 4 Days", "!RemindMe 4 Days", "I don't like either more than Wheaton.

This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership.

But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing. ", "\"They can't go more permissive then Congress\"\n\nBut, ostensibly, *Heller* threw congressional regulation up for review. ", "I'm aware of the supremacy clause. Ostensibly *Heller* put many of those federal regulations up for review, right? As such SCOTUS created a floor but no ceiling.  Many regulations must meet scrutiny now. Or am I wrong about that? \n\nYour logic would lead to results that could render the 2A meaningless. States have shown time and again that they cannot be trusted with minimum supervision. IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.  But the complications between state and federal law in this area is dangerous to the average person. Amd I think we all deserve some simplicity and minimal standardization here.\n\nEdit.

The 'choice' myth is bullshit anyway. But if labor is going to be shamed for its 'choices' then entrepreneurs need to STFU  when their choices force them to run their business.

And you're correct that states may not be more restrictive with that liberty. But they can certainly be more permissive. SCOTUS created a floor, not a ceiling. SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

That's just an opinion that you happen to hold.\n\nAnd you objected, saying you believe something like the PSR. \n\n&gt; This again. Why are you pretending to have not seen the words that I have written?\n\nI'm not, I'm well aware of what you've written. \n\n&gt; \"I view 'Internal explanations' as an attempt to maintain that you haven't thrown out the principle of sufficient reason, when in reality that's exactly what you've done.\"\n\nThis view is very silly, but also entirely irrelevant. \n\n&gt; \" I think they're equivalent. Meaning I think \"internal causation\" actually means \"no causation\". Other people, like you, obviously do not share my view. You think that internal causation is somehow distinct from no causation.\"\n\nSo you accept that \"internal causation\" means \"no causation\" and \"no causation\" means \"internal causation\"?\n\nIn which case, you'd accept the claim \"Everything that exists either has an external explanation or an internal explanation\". \n\nWhich is the PSR.

In my experience, most Christians believe they *do* deserve hell. \n\n&gt; 3rd bullet point: The Bible states that sin is a transgression of the law, the Torah was the law, therefore, sin is breaking the Torah law, that is my argument\n\nYou didn't provide this justification earlier, and either way it's bad.

Arguing isn't about informing people about your opinion. Arguing is about *justifying your views*. If you are incapable of justifying any view you have, you should not have it. If you are incapable of justifying these opinions, then you should abandon them. You have no reason to think they are true.\n\nSo it boils down to this: feelings are not good evidence.

Explaining my beliefs is justifying them\n\nNo, it is not. I could go into extravagant detail about how the Earth is hollow and Nazis live there who are planning on destroying the moon, but explaining *what* I believe doesn't get us any closer to those beliefs being justified.\n\nI understand *what* you believe, I just don't think there's any good reason to believe it. And you haven't given one. \n\n&gt;  I'm done with this argument because it is literally going nowhere, it's literally just me explaining my beliefs, and you going \"justify them\" than me trying to justify them, and then you ignoring what I said by saying \"don't explain, justify\" without realizing I can't justify without explaining my beliefs.\n\nYou've explained your beliefs plenty.

Meaning I think \"internal causation\" actually means \"no causation\". Other people, like you, obviously do not share my view. You think that internal causation is somehow distinct from no causation.\"\n\nSo you accept that \"internal causation\" means \"no causation\" and \"no causation\" means \"internal causation\"?\n\nIn which case, you'd accept the claim \"Everything that exists either has an external explanation or an internal explanation\". \n\nWhich is the PSR. So now you accept the PSR. Hence the contradiction. ", "Then you need some more premises to justify the use of science.

In my experience, most Christians believe they *do* deserve hell. \n\n&gt; 3rd bullet point: The Bible states that sin is a transgression of the law, the Torah was the law, therefore, sin is breaking the Torah law, that is my argument\n\nYou didn't provide this justification earlier, and either way it's bad.

I don't know, why do you think, it's my opinion, I have no argument other than this is my personal opinion\n\n&gt; 1st bullet point: also my personal opinion\n\nAnd why should I care at all about what your opinion is? Arguing isn't about informing people about your opinion. Arguing is about *justifying your views*. If you are incapable of justifying any view you have, you should not have it. If you are incapable of justifying these opinions, then you should abandon them. You have no reason to think they are true.\n\nSo it boils down to this: feelings are not good evidence.

Meaning I think \"internal causation\" actually means \"no causation\". Other people, like you, obviously do not share my view. You think that internal causation is somehow distinct from no causation.\"\n\nSo you accept that \"internal causation\" means \"no causation\" and \"no causation\" means \"internal causation\"?\n\nIn which case, you'd accept the claim \"Everything that exists either has an external explanation or an internal explanation\". \n\nWhich is the PSR. So now you accept the PSR. Hence the contradiction. ", "Then you need some more premises to justify the use of science.

In my experience, most Christians believe they *do* deserve hell. \n\n&gt; 3rd bullet point: The Bible states that sin is a transgression of the law, the Torah was the law, therefore, sin is breaking the Torah law, that is my argument\n\nYou didn't provide this justification earlier, and either way it's bad.

Arguing isn't about informing people about your opinion. Arguing is about *justifying your views*. If you are incapable of justifying any view you have, you should not have it. If you are incapable of justifying these opinions, then you should abandon them. You have no reason to think they are true.\n\nSo it boils down to this: feelings are not good evidence.

This is an assertion.\n\nSo now you think the Prime Mover has accidental properties?\n\n&gt; Yeah and then I ask why rejecting the most basic premises would stop you from giving me the latter premises. You ask why you should bother. And I say because this is a debate forum.\n\nThat's not a good reason to bother. \n\n&gt; Just because there must be at least one thing that everything else is 'moved by' doesn't mean that all of those things are 'contained' in the first thing.\n\nIt does in this case. \n\n&gt; That's not an argument that is proven correct by my acceptance that a thing's existence can be explained by nothing. That's just an opinion that you happen to hold.\n\nAnd you objected, saying you believe something like the PSR. \n\n&gt; This again. Why are you pretending to have not seen the words that I have written?\n\nI'm not, I'm well aware of what you've written. \n\n&gt; \"I view 'Internal explanations' as an attempt to maintain that you haven't thrown out the principle of sufficient reason, when in reality that's exactly what you've done.\"\n\nThis view is very silly, but also entirely irrelevant. \n\n&gt; \" I think they're equivalent. Meaning I think \"internal causation\" actually means \"no causation\". Other people, like you, obviously do not share my view. You think that internal causation is somehow distinct from no causation.\"\n\nSo you accept that \"internal causation\" means \"no causation\" and \"no causation\" means \"internal causation\"?\n\nIn which case, you'd accept the claim \"Everything that exists either has an external explanation or an internal explanation\". \n\nWhich is the PSR. So now you accept the PSR. Hence the contradiction. ", "Then you need some more premises to justify the use of science. It doesn't follow from your premises that science is a good way to learn about the universe. ", "&gt; 5th bullet point: I said by saying this we place limits on God, that was my argument.\n\nThat's your *claim*. Not a justification. And  you didn't respond to my objection. \n\n&gt; 4th bullet point: I am assuming most people do not think they deserve in eternity in agonizing torment for finite sins, that is my argument\n\nWhy should I care what most people think? In my experience, most Christians believe they *do* deserve hell. \n\n&gt; 3rd bullet point: The Bible states that sin is a transgression of the law, the Torah was the law, therefore, sin is breaking the Torah law, that is my argument\n\nYou didn't provide this justification earlier, and either way it's bad. It's not convincing. Because it's false. \n\n&gt; 2nd bullet point: in my opinion, not all people deserve death, why? I don't know, why do you think, it's my opinion, I have no argument other than this is my personal opinion\n\n&gt; 1st bullet point: also my personal opinion\n\nAnd why should I care at all about what your opinion is? Arguing isn't about informing people about your opinion. Arguing is about *justifying your views*. If you are incapable of justifying any view you have, you should not have it. If you are incapable of justifying these opinions, then you should abandon them. You have no reason to think they are true.\n\nSo it boils down to this: feelings are not good evidence. You need real justification for your belief. \n\nOr I guess you can just not care if you're wrong. I can't make you care about that. ", "So you don't believe science is a good way of learning about the universe?", "&gt; Where is your justification for anything you just said? \n\nI don't feel the need to provide any when you haven't. I don't have to prove the opposite of what you're saying, all I have to do is point out you haven't justified your claims. What has been presented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. \n\n&gt; I said before \"if you believe in the Bible, and you believe that a sin is a transgression of the law, and if you believe God gave the law to Moses, and if you don't follow the Torah, you are a sinner because you are breaking the law\" \n\nThat's a very different claim. That's a conditional claim. And it's true, *if* I believed that I'd accept the conclusion. \n\n&gt; You shouldn't care about what my opinion is. However, when arguing religion, something that can't be proven,\n\nNow here's the issue. I hold that claims about religion *can* be proven. Obviously. If I didn't believe that, why would I hold any opinions about religion?\n\n&gt; But so far every single time I state my belief and why I believe it, you literally just say \"you didn't justify it.\" How else can I justify my beliefs without explaining them? Explaining my beliefs is justifying them\n\nNo, it is not. I could go into extravagant detail about how the Earth is hollow and Nazis live there who are planning on destroying the moon, but explaining *what* I believe doesn't get us any closer to those beliefs being justified.\n\nI understand *what* you believe, I just don't think there's any good reason to believe it. And you haven't given one. \n\n&gt;  I'm done with this argument because it is literally going nowhere, it's literally just me explaining my beliefs, and you going \"justify them\" than me trying to justify them, and then you ignoring what I said by saying \"don't explain, justify\" without realizing I can't justify without explaining my beliefs.\n\nYou've explained your beliefs plenty. I understand  them. That is not the issue. The issue is that I do not agree. Which means you need to justify. Sure, you can't justify without explaining to some degree, but you've done the explaining and you haven't done the justifying.

That's just an opinion that you happen to hold.\n\nAnd you objected, saying you believe something like the PSR. \n\n&gt; This again. Why are you pretending to have not seen the words that I have written?\n\nI'm not, I'm well aware of what you've written. \n\n&gt; \"I view 'Internal explanations' as an attempt to maintain that you haven't thrown out the principle of sufficient reason, when in reality that's exactly what you've done.\"\n\nThis view is very silly, but also entirely irrelevant. \n\n&gt; \" I think they're equivalent. Meaning I think \"internal causation\" actually means \"no causation\". Other people, like you, obviously do not share my view. You think that internal causation is somehow distinct from no causation.\"\n\nSo you accept that \"internal causation\" means \"no causation\" and \"no causation\" means \"internal causation\"?\n\nIn which case, you'd accept the claim \"Everything that exists either has an external explanation or an internal explanation\". \n\nWhich is the PSR. So now you accept the PSR. Hence the contradiction. ", "Then you need some more premises to justify the use of science.

And  you didn't respond to my objection. \n\n&gt; 4th bullet point: I am assuming most people do not think they deserve in eternity in agonizing torment for finite sins, that is my argument\n\nWhy should I care what most people think? In my experience, most Christians believe they *do* deserve hell. \n\n&gt; 3rd bullet point: The Bible states that sin is a transgression of the law, the Torah was the law, therefore, sin is breaking the Torah law, that is my argument\n\nYou didn't provide this justification earlier, and either way it's bad.

Arguing isn't about informing people about your opinion. Arguing is about *justifying your views*. If you are incapable of justifying any view you have, you should not have it. If you are incapable of justifying these opinions, then you should abandon them. You have no reason to think they are true.\n\nSo it boils down to this: feelings are not good evidence. You need real justification for your belief. \n\nOr I guess you can just not care if you're wrong. I can't make you care about that.

If I didn't believe that, why would I hold any opinions about religion?\n\n&gt; But so far every single time I state my belief and why I believe it, you literally just say \"you didn't justify it.\" How else can I justify my beliefs without explaining them? Explaining my beliefs is justifying them\n\nNo, it is not. I could go into extravagant detail about how the Earth is hollow and Nazis live there who are planning on destroying the moon, but explaining *what* I believe doesn't get us any closer to those beliefs being justified.\n\nI understand *what* you believe, I just don't think there's any good reason to believe it. And you haven't given one. \n\n&gt;  I'm done with this argument because it is literally going nowhere, it's literally just me explaining my beliefs, and you going \"justify them\" than me trying to justify them, and then you ignoring what I said by saying \"don't explain, justify\" without realizing I can't justify without explaining my beliefs.\n\nYou've explained your beliefs plenty.

Meaning I think \"internal causation\" actually means \"no causation\". Other people, like you, obviously do not share my view. You think that internal causation is somehow distinct from no causation.\"\n\nSo you accept that \"internal causation\" means \"no causation\" and \"no causation\" means \"internal causation\"?\n\nIn which case, you'd accept the claim \"Everything that exists either has an external explanation or an internal explanation\". \n\nWhich is the PSR.

This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

And Thresh manages to hook ur ADC and does his QE combo, u might wanna W ur ADC and proceed to Q-ing and AA the enemy ADC, NOT the enemy support. This one,  I took a loong looong time to realize.

I tend to skip over anything that looks worn (hello, pilling) or brands that I know I could snag new for less than a latte, like Old Navy or F21.\n\nSo, what I end up hunting for are pieces that catch my eye with a unique flair, in colors that pop, crafted with quality that speaks volumes, and from brands that aren't dime a dozen. It's about filtering out the noise and zoning in on the gems.", "For sure, I sized up half from what I normally wear, and they still felt somewhat snug till I adjusted to them.", "Why would there be a difference in quality between the ones sold on Amazon and those at Nordstrom?

And then, there\u2019s leather that's been tampered with - imagine, bright blue or slapped with a patent finish - maintenance turns into a real chore at that point.\n\nOverall, leather offers a durability that allows for rejuvenation over time, unlike vinyl and similar materials where once it's damaged, it's game over.", "Totally normal in this area, which is a stark contrast to where I was raised.

When it comes to the top-tier thrift shops, my go-tos are Sell Your Sole in Belltown (admittedly pricey but meticulously selected items), Driftwood in Madrona (a bit smaller but equally well curated), Le Frock in Capitol Hill (don't miss the great 50% discount rack upstairs and their exclusive PNW designers section), and Fury in Madison Park (primarily caters to an older demographic but still offers some decent finds).\n\nOn the budget-friendlier side, you've got several Buffalo Exchanges and Crossroads to check out, along with a plethora of neighborhood stores offering midrange but standard fare. If you find yourself nearby, you should also pop into Cherry Consignment in West Seattle, Funky Jane's also in West Seattle, Take 2 in Capitol Hill, and Gather in Columbia City.

And you can definitely pull it off by tweaking those proportions just right. \n\nIn terms of my style, I lean towards a mix of edgy/artistic while still emphasizing a body-hugging appearance to compliment the petite figure - aiming for that sexy/flattering vibe. \n\nTo nail that boxy look, I'd likely go for a chunky tunic-length sweater paired with leggings or skinny jeans, being careful not to let the top extend past mid-thigh or for it to finish right at the hips\u2019 widest part. Occasionally, I'll opt for something loose (without going too long) that features a broad neckline to expose a bit of shoulder. I generally steer clear of high necklines since they don't do much for my short neck, but I've snagged a sleeveless boxy top that sort of breaks this rule because it shows off enough arm to win me over. \n\nWith skinny jeans, I can manage to look decent though not stunning unless I throw on some smaller footwear. But personally, I'm all about the tougher shoes, so I pair them with ankle or knee-high boots, or something hefty to add some visual weight down below. (Mixing in my Chucks with a playful skirt is my go-to for a more whimsical silhouette, just to keep things fresh.) \n\nWhile I may never fit the classic 'hourglass' mold or be tagged as voluptuous, it doesn't mean I can't find ways to make a style work for me, right?"]}

So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs.

I save my effort for hunting down pieces that actually excite me, things that blend the familiar with a dash of the unconventional, quality over quantity, always.

Plus, I hit up my local thrift store every couple of weeks - just a quick pop-in.

True, cobblers can work miracles on quality leather. \n\nHowever, let\u2019s not kid ourselves.

Then, there\u2019s the travesty of \u2018leather\u2019 boots that are nothing more than shoddy material laminated over junk, which no self-respecting cobbler would dare touch. Furthermore, leather treatments, like those vibrant dyes or glossy finishes, are a nightmare for upkeep. \n\nSo, while leather offers some longevity and the chance for restoration, remember this: once materials like vinyl give out, they're as useful as a screen door on a submarine.", "It's wildly prevalent around here.

Embrace it.\n\nNow, if you're after some high-end thrift options, let me lay it down for you: Sell Your Sole in Belltown, it's pricey but the selection is top-notch. Driftwood in Madrona is on the smaller side, yet meticulously curated. Over in Capitol Hill, Le Frock has a fantastic 50% off rack upstairs and a noteworthy section dedicated to PNW designers. Fury in Madison Park tends to cater to an older crowd but don't let that deter you; there are gems to be found.\n\nLooking for more budget-friendly spots? Well, we're replete with Buffalo Exchanges and Crossroads. Other neighborhood joints with a decent mix at midrange prices include Cherry Consignment and Funky Jane's both in West Seattle, Take 2 and Gather in Capitol Hill and Columbia City, respectively.

For something boxy, I'd probably rock a hefty, tunic-sized sweater and strap on some leggings or those skin-tight jeans, always mindful to cut off the sweater at mid-thigh. Can't let it sprawl over the widest part of the hips\u2014that's just asking for trouble. Or maybe opt for a loose-fitting item that's still short enough, maybe throw in a broad neckline to flash a hint of shoulder. I generally steer clear of high necklines\u2014they do absolutely nothing for my short neck\u2014but if a sleeveless boxy top gives my arms some airtime, I might just give it a go.\n\nNow, skinny jeans and me? We have a complicated relationship. They're alright, but throw on some puny shoes, and it's just meh. I lean towards beefier footwear anyway\u2014ankle boots, knee-highs, or something that plants some weight down by the feet. I\u2019ve been known to slap on some Chucks with a twirly skirt for those 'rebel child' days.

Or maybe a baggy shirt, nothing too long, with a wide enough neckline to show some shoulder. High necklines? Not for me, make my neck look short, but I go for a sleeveless boxy top if it shows off enough of my arms. With skinny jeans, I pull it off okay, but not spectacular or anything, always paired with chunky shoes\u2014ankle boots, knee-highs, or something that brings some heft to the look.

And you're correct that states may not be more restrictive with that liberty. But they can certainly be more permissive. SCOTUS created a floor, not a ceiling. SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

I realize sometimes disenaging your ADC from enemys supp might not be as efficient as procceeding to CC-ing the enemys ADC instead, even if the enemy supp has significantly lower hp than the enemy ADC.", "I been telling yall bitches; Cutthroat, worse-than-fucking-prison Drag Queens in a fucking competition &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; RuPauls Best Friends Race.

Also I dont know your rank, but I guess you can draw an extrapolation if youre better at the game.\n\n1.Most supports can engage , heck even Janna can although shes more of a peeler. Ayways tank supports are the traditional good engagers. The one I hate fighting the most is Leona..... fuck Leona.. fuck Leona.. fuck Leona.. her level 1 powerspike + ignite is stupid. Nautilus is kinda similar.\n\nThresh has been consistently good eventho there has been so many patches. So he gets the honorable mention. Blitzcranks is kinda similar.. Thresh has more potential.\n\nAlistar too yes, but I dont see him much in low elo. He can be a nuinsance when paired with a premade, but his engage is very short ranged. Eversince his nerf (which was before me started playing) , hes not as popular(?) , I think. This is based one me reading past guides.\n\nTaric has been solid since his rework. Sure his dps is lower now but hes good at keeping your ADC alive.. I love playing him with Twitch. Twitch can proc his Q stun while hes in stealth. Lmao. His W and E procs Windspeaker while most utility supports has only 1 skill to proc Windspeakers Blessing.\n\nSupport Sion has high win rate.  Good engager (in bush+ Q)\n\nTldr; Leona is the easiest to use in lower elo. Recommended ! Freelo champ.

And you're correct that states may not be more restrictive with that liberty. But they can certainly be more permissive. SCOTUS created a floor, not a ceiling. SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing. ", "\"They can't go more permissive then Congress\"\n\nBut, ostensibly, *Heller* threw congressional regulation up for review. ", "I'm aware of the supremacy clause. Ostensibly *Heller* put many of those federal regulations up for review, right? As such SCOTUS created a floor but no ceiling.  Many regulations must meet scrutiny now. Or am I wrong about that? \n\nYour logic would lead to results that could render the 2A meaningless. States have shown time and again that they cannot be trusted with minimum supervision. IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.  But the complications between state and federal law in this area is dangerous to the average person. Amd I think we all deserve some simplicity and minimal standardization here.\n\nEdit.

This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing.

Ostensibly *Heller* put many of those federal regulations up for review, right? As such SCOTUS created a floor but no ceiling.  Many regulations must meet scrutiny now. Or am I wrong about that? \n\nYour logic would lead to results that could render the 2A meaningless. States have shown time and again that they cannot be trusted with minimum supervision. IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs.

They absolutely do it right and I'm not putting them down but Star Citizen started as a kickstarter with reasonable (while still ambitious) expectations that quickly grew into something much bigger than originally intended. They had to go out and hire multiple different parties to work on the various pieces of the games that are constantly being developed (that we get constantly updated on).\n\nI'm not sure what you expect to surpass the scope of what they are aiming for, nothing even close has been announced and to have 3.0 here in 2017 which represents a first full iteration of the game essentially I doubt something will overcome that.\n\nNMS blew it, they're an inexperienced developer who fell to hype, but not like they care as they are rolling around in the money of pre-orders. Star Citizen was starting down this road but quickly fixed the ship, whenever they missed the initial deadlines and saw the community backlash they opted to not state any further 'release dates'. Sure we may get general time frames but they've chosen to take their time so everything is properly done and obviously the community has accepted that as it keeps growing and the funds continue to pile up.\n\nCould it all turn out too good to be true? Sure, every game runs that risk. But considering the amount of transparency they provide from pretty much every single group working on the game it is quite clear they are building the game we all want and envisioned. In the end all we can do is wait and see. 5 Years of development is perfectly reasonable for a game such as this and I wouldn't even mind 2 more for it to be fully completed.", "RemindMe! 4 Days", "!RemindMe 4 Days", "I don't like either more than Wheaton.

Of course he isn't receiver #1 material but then again nobody in the NFL is whenever AB is on the field.

SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

I realize sometimes disenaging your ADC from enemys supp might not be as efficient as procceeding to CC-ing the enemys ADC instead, even if the enemy supp has significantly lower hp than the enemy ADC.", "I been telling yall bitches; Cutthroat, worse-than-fucking-prison Drag Queens in a fucking competition &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; RuPauls Best Friends Race. Season 8 was mediocre and less memorable for the lack of drama. I love all the cast but it doesnt mean Season 8 made good tv. Season 7 was a GREAT TV SHOW. \n\nWe fucking need Villains edit.

Also I dont know your rank, but I guess you can draw an extrapolation if youre better at the game.\n\n1.Most supports can engage , heck even Janna can although shes more of a peeler. Ayways tank supports are the traditional good engagers. The one I hate fighting the most is Leona..... fuck Leona.. fuck Leona.. fuck Leona.. her level 1 powerspike + ignite is stupid. Nautilus is kinda similar.\n\nThresh has been consistently good eventho there has been so many patches. So he gets the honorable mention. Blitzcranks is kinda similar.. Thresh has more potential.\n\nAlistar too yes, but I dont see him much in low elo. He can be a nuinsance when paired with a premade, but his engage is very short ranged. Eversince his nerf (which was before me started playing) , hes not as popular(?) , I think. This is based one me reading past guides.\n\nTaric has been solid since his rework. Sure his dps is lower now but hes good at keeping your ADC alive.. I love playing him with Twitch. Twitch can proc his Q stun while hes in stealth. Lmao. His W and E procs Windspeaker while most utility supports has only 1 skill to proc Windspeakers Blessing.\n\nSupport Sion has high win rate.  Good engager (in bush+ Q)\n\nTldr; Leona is the easiest to use in lower elo. Recommended ! Freelo champ. Taric is really good too, hes just.. boring to use"], "transferred_texts": [["Uhm hello?

And you're correct that states may not be more restrictive with that liberty. But they can certainly be more permissive. SCOTUS created a floor, not a ceiling. SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing.

Ostensibly *Heller* put many of those federal regulations up for review, right? As such SCOTUS created a floor but no ceiling.  Many regulations must meet scrutiny now. Or am I wrong about that? \n\nYour logic would lead to results that could render the 2A meaningless. States have shown time and again that they cannot be trusted with minimum supervision. IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

The 'choice' myth is bullshit anyway. But if labor is going to be shamed for its 'choices' then entrepreneurs need to STFU  when their choices force them to run their business. These people have no sense of equity. Finally, everyday is Business Day in America. Can labor have just one day for them? Jesus. ", "'Inequality is a feature, not a bug.' \n\nThis guy is a piece of shit. The opposite of economic inequality is economic equity, not equality.

Meaning, we want gains in proportion to those at the top - not necessarily the same as those at the top. \n\nAnd I want more freedom to determine my quality of life in a way that is not connected to a standard of living. But I don't want to live in perpetual crises and anxiety because I made that choice. He cites flat screen TVs and other crap as evidence that inequality 'works.'

And you're correct that states may not be more restrictive with that liberty. But they can certainly be more permissive. SCOTUS created a floor, not a ceiling. SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing.

Ostensibly *Heller* put many of those federal regulations up for review, right? As such SCOTUS created a floor but no ceiling.  Many regulations must meet scrutiny now. Or am I wrong about that? \n\nYour logic would lead to results that could render the 2A meaningless. States have shown time and again that they cannot be trusted with minimum supervision. IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.  But the complications between state and federal law in this area is dangerous to the average person. Amd I think we all deserve some simplicity and minimal standardization here.\n\nEdit.
