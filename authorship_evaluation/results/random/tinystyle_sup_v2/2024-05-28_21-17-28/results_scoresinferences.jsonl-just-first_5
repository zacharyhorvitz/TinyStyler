SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

This is an assertion.\n\nSo now you think the Prime Mover has accidental properties?\n\n&gt; Yeah and then I ask why rejecting the most basic premises would stop you from giving me the latter premises. You ask why you should bother. And I say because this is a debate forum.\n\nThat's not a good reason to bother. \n\n&gt; Just because there must be at least one thing that everything else is 'moved by' doesn't mean that all of those things are 'contained' in the first thing.\n\nIt does in this case. \n\n&gt; That's not an argument that is proven correct by my acceptance that a thing's existence can be explained by nothing. That's just an opinion that you happen to hold.\n\nAnd you objected, saying you believe something like the PSR. \n\n&gt; This again. Why are you pretending to have not seen the words that I have written?\n\nI'm not, I'm well aware of what you've written. \n\n&gt; \"I view 'Internal explanations' as an attempt to maintain that you haven't thrown out the principle of sufficient reason, when in reality that's exactly what you've done.\"\n\nThis view is very silly, but also entirely irrelevant. \n\n&gt; \" I think they're equivalent. Meaning I think \"internal causation\" actually means \"no causation\". Other people, like you, obviously do not share my view. You think that internal causation is somehow distinct from no causation.\"\n\nSo you accept that \"internal causation\" means \"no causation\" and \"no causation\" means \"internal causation\"?\n\nIn which case, you'd accept the claim \"Everything that exists either has an external explanation or an internal explanation\". \n\nWhich is the PSR. So now you accept the PSR. Hence the contradiction. ", "Then you need some more premises to justify the use of science.

And  you didn't respond to my objection. \n\n&gt; 4th bullet point: I am assuming most people do not think they deserve in eternity in agonizing torment for finite sins, that is my argument\n\nWhy should I care what most people think? In my experience, most Christians believe they *do* deserve hell. \n\n&gt; 3rd bullet point: The Bible states that sin is a transgression of the law, the Torah was the law, therefore, sin is breaking the Torah law, that is my argument\n\nYou didn't provide this justification earlier, and either way it's bad. It's not convincing. Because it's false. \n\n&gt; 2nd bullet point: in my opinion, not all people deserve death, why? I don't know, why do you think, it's my opinion, I have no argument other than this is my personal opinion\n\n&gt; 1st bullet point: also my personal opinion\n\nAnd why should I care at all about what your opinion is? Arguing isn't about informing people about your opinion. Arguing is about *justifying your views*. If you are incapable of justifying any view you have, you should not have it. If you are incapable of justifying these opinions, then you should abandon them. You have no reason to think they are true.\n\nSo it boils down to this: feelings are not good evidence.

I don't have to prove the opposite of what you're saying, all I have to do is point out you haven't justified your claims. What has been presented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. \n\n&gt; I said before \"if you believe in the Bible, and you believe that a sin is a transgression of the law, and if you believe God gave the law to Moses, and if you don't follow the Torah, you are a sinner because you are breaking the law\" \n\nThat's a very different claim. That's a conditional claim. And it's true, *if* I believed that I'd accept the conclusion. \n\n&gt; You shouldn't care about what my opinion is. However, when arguing religion, something that can't be proven,\n\nNow here's the issue. I hold that claims about religion *can* be proven. Obviously. If I didn't believe that, why would I hold any opinions about religion?\n\n&gt; But so far every single time I state my belief and why I believe it, you literally just say \"you didn't justify it.\" How else can I justify my beliefs without explaining them? Explaining my beliefs is justifying them\n\nNo, it is not. I could go into extravagant detail about how the Earth is hollow and Nazis live there who are planning on destroying the moon, but explaining *what* I believe doesn't get us any closer to those beliefs being justified.\n\nI understand *what* you believe, I just don't think there's any good reason to believe it. And you haven't given one. \n\n&gt;  I'm done with this argument because it is literally going nowhere, it's literally just me explaining my beliefs, and you going \"justify them\" than me trying to justify them, and then you ignoring what I said by saying \"don't explain, justify\" without realizing I can't justify without explaining my beliefs.\n\nYou've explained your beliefs plenty. I understand  them. That is not the issue. The issue is that I do not agree. Which means you need to justify.

You ask why you should bother. And I say because this is a debate forum.\n\nThat's not a good reason to bother. \n\n&gt; Just because there must be at least one thing that everything else is 'moved by' doesn't mean that all of those things are 'contained' in the first thing.\n\nIt does in this case. \n\n&gt; That's not an argument that is proven correct by my acceptance that a thing's existence can be explained by nothing. That's just an opinion that you happen to hold.\n\nAnd you objected, saying you believe something like the PSR. \n\n&gt; This again. Why are you pretending to have not seen the words that I have written?\n\nI'm not, I'm well aware of what you've written. \n\n&gt; \"I view 'Internal explanations' as an attempt to maintain that you haven't thrown out the principle of sufficient reason, when in reality that's exactly what you've done.\"\n\nThis view is very silly, but also entirely irrelevant. \n\n&gt; \" I think they're equivalent. Meaning I think \"internal causation\" actually means \"no causation\". Other people, like you, obviously do not share my view. You think that internal causation is somehow distinct from no causation.\"\n\nSo you accept that \"internal causation\" means \"no causation\" and \"no causation\" means \"internal causation\"?\n\nIn which case, you'd accept the claim \"Everything that exists either has an external explanation or an internal explanation\". \n\nWhich is the PSR. So now you accept the PSR. Hence the contradiction. ", "Then you need some more premises to justify the use of science.

And  you didn't respond to my objection. \n\n&gt; 4th bullet point: I am assuming most people do not think they deserve in eternity in agonizing torment for finite sins, that is my argument\n\nWhy should I care what most people think? In my experience, most Christians believe they *do* deserve hell. \n\n&gt; 3rd bullet point: The Bible states that sin is a transgression of the law, the Torah was the law, therefore, sin is breaking the Torah law, that is my argument\n\nYou didn't provide this justification earlier, and either way it's bad. It's not convincing. Because it's false. \n\n&gt; 2nd bullet point: in my opinion, not all people deserve death, why? I don't know, why do you think, it's my opinion, I have no argument other than this is my personal opinion\n\n&gt; 1st bullet point: also my personal opinion\n\nAnd why should I care at all about what your opinion is? Arguing isn't about informing people about your opinion. Arguing is about *justifying your views*. If you are incapable of justifying any view you have, you should not have it. If you are incapable of justifying these opinions, then you should abandon them. You have no reason to think they are true.\n\nSo it boils down to this: feelings are not good evidence. You need real justification for your belief. \n\nOr I guess you can just not care if you're wrong. I can't make you care about that.

I don't have to prove the opposite of what you're saying, all I have to do is point out you haven't justified your claims. What has been presented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. \n\n&gt; I said before \"if you believe in the Bible, and you believe that a sin is a transgression of the law, and if you believe God gave the law to Moses, and if you don't follow the Torah, you are a sinner because you are breaking the law\" \n\nThat's a very different claim. That's a conditional claim. And it's true, *if* I believed that I'd accept the conclusion. \n\n&gt; You shouldn't care about what my opinion is. However, when arguing religion, something that can't be proven,\n\nNow here's the issue. I hold that claims about religion *can* be proven. Obviously. If I didn't believe that, why would I hold any opinions about religion?\n\n&gt; But so far every single time I state my belief and why I believe it, you literally just say \"you didn't justify it.\" How else can I justify my beliefs without explaining them? Explaining my beliefs is justifying them\n\nNo, it is not. I could go into extravagant detail about how the Earth is hollow and Nazis live there who are planning on destroying the moon, but explaining *what* I believe doesn't get us any closer to those beliefs being justified.\n\nI understand *what* you believe, I just don't think there's any good reason to believe it. And you haven't given one. \n\n&gt;  I'm done with this argument because it is literally going nowhere, it's literally just me explaining my beliefs, and you going \"justify them\" than me trying to justify them, and then you ignoring what I said by saying \"don't explain, justify\" without realizing I can't justify without explaining my beliefs.\n\nYou've explained your beliefs plenty. I understand  them. That is not the issue. The issue is that I do not agree. Which means you need to justify.

In my experience, most Christians believe they *do* deserve hell. \n\n&gt; 3rd bullet point: The Bible states that sin is a transgression of the law, the Torah was the law, therefore, sin is breaking the Torah law, that is my argument\n\nYou didn't provide this justification earlier, and either way it's bad. It's not convincing. Because it's false. \n\n&gt; 2nd bullet point: in my opinion, not all people deserve death, why? I don't know, why do you think, it's my opinion, I have no argument other than this is my personal opinion\n\n&gt; 1st bullet point: also my personal opinion\n\nAnd why should I care at all about what your opinion is? Arguing isn't about informing people about your opinion. Arguing is about *justifying your views*. If you are incapable of justifying any view you have, you should not have it. If you are incapable of justifying these opinions, then you should abandon them. You have no reason to think they are true.\n\nSo it boils down to this: feelings are not good evidence. You need real justification for your belief. \n\nOr I guess you can just not care if you're wrong. I can't make you care about that.

I don't have to prove the opposite of what you're saying, all I have to do is point out you haven't justified your claims. What has been presented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. \n\n&gt; I said before \"if you believe in the Bible, and you believe that a sin is a transgression of the law, and if you believe God gave the law to Moses, and if you don't follow the Torah, you are a sinner because you are breaking the law\" \n\nThat's a very different claim. That's a conditional claim. And it's true, *if* I believed that I'd accept the conclusion. \n\n&gt; You shouldn't care about what my opinion is. However, when arguing religion, something that can't be proven,\n\nNow here's the issue. I hold that claims about religion *can* be proven. Obviously. If I didn't believe that, why would I hold any opinions about religion?\n\n&gt; But so far every single time I state my belief and why I believe it, you literally just say \"you didn't justify it.\" How else can I justify my beliefs without explaining them? Explaining my beliefs is justifying them\n\nNo, it is not. I could go into extravagant detail about how the Earth is hollow and Nazis live there who are planning on destroying the moon, but explaining *what* I believe doesn't get us any closer to those beliefs being justified.\n\nI understand *what* you believe, I just don't think there's any good reason to believe it. And you haven't given one. \n\n&gt;  I'm done with this argument because it is literally going nowhere, it's literally just me explaining my beliefs, and you going \"justify them\" than me trying to justify them, and then you ignoring what I said by saying \"don't explain, justify\" without realizing I can't justify without explaining my beliefs.\n\nYou've explained your beliefs plenty. I understand  them. That is not the issue. The issue is that I do not agree. Which means you need to justify.

At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs.

This is an assertion.\n\nSo now you think the Prime Mover has accidental properties?\n\n&gt; Yeah and then I ask why rejecting the most basic premises would stop you from giving me the latter premises. You ask why you should bother. And I say because this is a debate forum.\n\nThat's not a good reason to bother. \n\n&gt; Just because there must be at least one thing that everything else is 'moved by' doesn't mean that all of those things are 'contained' in the first thing.\n\nIt does in this case. \n\n&gt; That's not an argument that is proven correct by my acceptance that a thing's existence can be explained by nothing. That's just an opinion that you happen to hold.\n\nAnd you objected, saying you believe something like the PSR. \n\n&gt; This again. Why are you pretending to have not seen the words that I have written?\n\nI'm not, I'm well aware of what you've written. \n\n&gt; \"I view 'Internal explanations' as an attempt to maintain that you haven't thrown out the principle of sufficient reason, when in reality that's exactly what you've done.\"\n\nThis view is very silly, but also entirely irrelevant. \n\n&gt; \" I think they're equivalent. Meaning I think \"internal causation\" actually means \"no causation\". Other people, like you, obviously do not share my view. You think that internal causation is somehow distinct from no causation.\"\n\nSo you accept that \"internal causation\" means \"no causation\" and \"no causation\" means \"internal causation\"?\n\nIn which case, you'd accept the claim \"Everything that exists either has an external explanation or an internal explanation\". \n\nWhich is the PSR. So now you accept the PSR. Hence the contradiction. ", "Then you need some more premises to justify the use of science. It doesn't follow from your premises that science is a good way to learn about the universe. ", "&gt; 5th bullet point: I said by saying this we place limits on God, that was my argument.\n\nThat's your *claim*. Not a justification. And  you didn't respond to my objection. \n\n&gt; 4th bullet point: I am assuming most people do not think they deserve in eternity in agonizing torment for finite sins, that is my argument\n\nWhy should I care what most people think? In my experience, most Christians believe they *do* deserve hell. \n\n&gt; 3rd bullet point: The Bible states that sin is a transgression of the law, the Torah was the law, therefore, sin is breaking the Torah law, that is my argument\n\nYou didn't provide this justification earlier, and either way it's bad. It's not convincing. Because it's false. \n\n&gt; 2nd bullet point: in my opinion, not all people deserve death, why? I don't know, why do you think, it's my opinion, I have no argument other than this is my personal opinion\n\n&gt; 1st bullet point: also my personal opinion\n\nAnd why should I care at all about what your opinion is? Arguing isn't about informing people about your opinion. Arguing is about *justifying your views*. If you are incapable of justifying any view you have, you should not have it. If you are incapable of justifying these opinions, then you should abandon them. You have no reason to think they are true.\n\nSo it boils down to this: feelings are not good evidence. You need real justification for your belief. \n\nOr I guess you can just not care if you're wrong. I can't make you care about that. ", "So you don't believe science is a good way of learning about the universe?", "&gt; Where is your justification for anything you just said? \n\nI don't feel the need to provide any when you haven't. I don't have to prove the opposite of what you're saying, all I have to do is point out you haven't justified your claims. What has been presented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. \n\n&gt; I said before \"if you believe in the Bible, and you believe that a sin is a transgression of the law, and if you believe God gave the law to Moses, and if you don't follow the Torah, you are a sinner because you are breaking the law\" \n\nThat's a very different claim. That's a conditional claim. And it's true, *if* I believed that I'd accept the conclusion. \n\n&gt; You shouldn't care about what my opinion is. However, when arguing religion, something that can't be proven,\n\nNow here's the issue. I hold that claims about religion *can* be proven. Obviously. If I didn't believe that, why would I hold any opinions about religion?\n\n&gt; But so far every single time I state my belief and why I believe it, you literally just say \"you didn't justify it.\" How else can I justify my beliefs without explaining them? Explaining my beliefs is justifying them\n\nNo, it is not. I could go into extravagant detail about how the Earth is hollow and Nazis live there who are planning on destroying the moon, but explaining *what* I believe doesn't get us any closer to those beliefs being justified.\n\nI understand *what* you believe, I just don't think there's any good reason to believe it. And you haven't given one. \n\n&gt;  I'm done with this argument because it is literally going nowhere, it's literally just me explaining my beliefs, and you going \"justify them\" than me trying to justify them, and then you ignoring what I said by saying \"don't explain, justify\" without realizing I can't justify without explaining my beliefs.\n\nYou've explained your beliefs plenty. I understand  them. That is not the issue. The issue is that I do not agree. Which means you need to justify. Sure, you can't justify without explaining to some degree, but you've done the explaining and you haven't done the justifying.

", "&gt;Okay, but the argument being valid doesn't entail that it's sound, so it may have a premise that is necessarily false. \n\nYes, that's more or less what I said. \n\n&gt; Accordingly, I see no relevance to the question of whether the \"invisible pink unicorn\" possibly exists nor why you should grant that it does.\n\nI don't see an obvious logical contradiction so I'll grant that it possibly exist.

Arguing isn't about informing people about your opinion. Arguing is about *justifying your views*. If you are incapable of justifying any view you have, you should not have it. If you are incapable of justifying these opinions, then you should abandon them. You have no reason to think they are true.\n\nSo it boils down to this: feelings are not good evidence.

I understand  them. That is not the issue. The issue is that I do not agree. Which means you need to justify. Sure, you can't justify without explaining to some degree, but you've done the explaining and you haven't done the justifying.

So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

And you're correct that states may not be more restrictive with that liberty. But they can certainly be more permissive. SCOTUS created a floor, not a ceiling. SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

Ayways tank supports are the traditional good engagers. The one I hate fighting the most is Leona..... fuck Leona.. fuck Leona.. fuck Leona.. her level 1 powerspike + ignite is stupid. Nautilus is kinda similar.\n\nThresh has been consistently good eventho there has been so many patches. So he gets the honorable mention. Blitzcranks is kinda similar.. Thresh has more potential.\n\nAlistar too yes, but I dont see him much in low elo. He can be a nuinsance when paired with a premade, but his engage is very short ranged. Eversince his nerf (which was before me started playing) , hes not as popular(?) , I think. This is based one me reading past guides.\n\nTaric has been solid since his rework. Sure his dps is lower now but hes good at keeping your ADC alive.. I love playing him with Twitch. Twitch can proc his Q stun while hes in stealth. Lmao. His W and E procs Windspeaker while most utility supports has only 1 skill to proc Windspeakers Blessing.\n\nSupport Sion has high win rate.

And you're correct that states may not be more restrictive with that liberty. But they can certainly be more permissive. SCOTUS created a floor, not a ceiling. SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

Or am I wrong about that? \n\nYour logic would lead to results that could render the 2A meaningless. States have shown time and again that they cannot be trusted with minimum supervision. IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs.

SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing.

Or am I wrong about that? \n\nYour logic would lead to results that could render the 2A meaningless. States have shown time and again that they cannot be trusted with minimum supervision. IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

And you're correct that states may not be more restrictive with that liberty. But they can certainly be more permissive. SCOTUS created a floor, not a ceiling. SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing. ", "\"They can't go more permissive then Congress\"\n\nBut, ostensibly, *Heller* threw congressional regulation up for review. ", "I'm aware of the supremacy clause. Ostensibly *Heller* put many of those federal regulations up for review, right? As such SCOTUS created a floor but no ceiling.  Many regulations must meet scrutiny now. Or am I wrong about that? \n\nYour logic would lead to results that could render the 2A meaningless. States have shown time and again that they cannot be trusted with minimum supervision. IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.  But the complications between state and federal law in this area is dangerous to the average person. Amd I think we all deserve some simplicity and minimal standardization here.\n\nEdit.

SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards.

IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.

Even then, I didn't become an active Twitter user until the IAVA scandal. To be completely honest, I still have almost no understanding of how it works, but I relentlessly retweet anything related to Gary and make a few tweets of my own when I can think of something to say that hasn't already been said... I have to admit, though, I'm really looking forward to going back to avoiding social media again!", "I think FF will evolve to incorporate all these better metrics of success on the field", "Facebook post to Cornell Republicans:\n\n&gt; Thank you, Cornell Republicans, for your courage. Leaders often have to act before an action becomes popular. Make no mistake, you are leaders and are deserving of praise for your foresight, integrity, and leadership.\n\nReply to 5-star Facebook reviews on NYFCR page:\n\n&gt; Please reconsider your 5-star review of NYFCR. Yesterday's actions (revoking the credentials of Cornell University's chapter in retribution for an endorsement of a candidate other than Trump) are certainly not representative of a five-star organization. Interested in learning more about what the NYFCR is striking out against? Please come on over to reddit.com/r/GaryJohnson and take this opportunity to learn a bit about former Republican Governor Johnson's policies and, again, please reconsider your 5-star review of NYFCR.
