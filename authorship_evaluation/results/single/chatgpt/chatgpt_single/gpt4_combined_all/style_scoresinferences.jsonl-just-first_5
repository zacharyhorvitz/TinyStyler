He pretty much runs the athletic department. He has access to recruits and donors.

He pretty much runs the athletic department. He has access to recruits and donors. He said he wanted an indoor football practice facility, and the chancellor asked him how tall he wanted the roofline to be. \nMaybe, and I don't know him, but maybe he wants a prestige job as kind of an ego thing, but really he's got a sweet deal.", "No shit. Did not know. \n\nI could be convinced to work there just for the Song girls. Best cheerleaders in football. ", "Ah, I see. Possibly. He was asked about this just this weekend and it didn't sound like he was too interested. \n\nHe mentioned he liked to be a father figure and develop young athletes into young men, and sounded very sincere. He came from a broken home IIRC, and I genuinely think he takes pride in shaping people. \nOnce again, I'm not a psychoanalyst, and I didn't stay in a Holiday Inn Express last night FWIW ", "Cool. How about donating some money to the university so it can do important stuff like keep the lights on. \n\nBasically it's the equivalent of being that guy who doesn't have money for lunch and asks his buddies to help him out, but has an XBox one and a new iPhone 7.", "No, they can spend money to do their job. Spending what looks to be $12- 15million in buyouts for nothing, to hire a coach and staff for an additional 10-12 million dollars a year, thus paying for two coaches salaries while only one is working, by an organization that is... How do we say.... fiscally insolvent to the point of almost being incapable of its primary function of education, all to win another maybe 2 or three games per season seems a bit imprudent. \n\nI'm not sure where that last part comes from. Don't see any articles about UH being broke, and in the last few years they've built a ton of new housing on campus as well as new buildings for business and I think nanotechnology (not sure, I've been out awhile) but I digress. If the school were insolvent, I would maintain the same position and say we should get our fiscal house in order before blowing it on getting a marginally better coach.", "Yeah, I don't think he does stop at Houston, I'm just saying the list of possible attractive options drops provided Houston gets in a P5, which at this point I think happens. He'll have money and a chance at championships as well as having recruiting on easy mode. \nHe won't have prestige which is why I think he eventually leaves, I just don't see a lot of lateral moves in between. \nWhat Houston does give he wouldn't have anywhere else is no pressure and unlimited control, as well as a good family situation which he has talked about.", "Oh I get it. I negotiated a contract with Texas A&amp;M, excuse me, the 12th Man Foundation and they were very clear they were not part of the university despite having the seal all over the letterhead. \nI'm saying its a legal fiction, like putting my assets and income in a trust that I benefit from and then running up a personal tab and claiming poverty when the bill comes due.\nAre they affiliated? Legally maybe not, but we're arguing propriety. \nSince money is fungible, I guess I'm saying it would be a better use of resources from a government standpoint to pay your bills.", "Have an up vote.

LSU would be an end jump. I think what I'm saying is he just doesn't want any blueblood, he wants one or two in particular.
