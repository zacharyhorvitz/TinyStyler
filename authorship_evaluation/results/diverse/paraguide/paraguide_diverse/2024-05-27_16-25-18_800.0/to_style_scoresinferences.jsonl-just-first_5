Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

If the bark hasn't been treated right first, the organisms that make it fuzzy are ubiquitous, and their spores will land on it and make it moldy.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, I had neglected to aggressively cut the roots, not really being sure how to tell what was dead or not.\n\nYou tug on them, and if they fall apart like in segments, they're good and dead. Even if they're not alive, a few dead roots don't hurt all that much.\n\nWhere are you getting your bark from? Good bark is hard to find these days. There are other options, too- including pure sphagnum, and Hydroton (hydroponics store) works if nothing else does.\n\nPics would help a lot.", "&gt;s sphagnum that much more resistant to rot/fungus then that I should just go straight sphagnum? I thought that held too much water and resulted in rot and fungus anyway.\n\nSphagnum does hold a lot of water. The trick is to water/fertilize only lightly (80% of the time), and then once every 4-5-6 waterings flush the hell out of it with nice, clean water- no fertilizer. That way, it's only really *wet* a small portion of the time.

(As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control.

Basic rettiquite calls to use the downvote for things that don't contribute to the discussion, and I'd say a humorous comment such as his contributes well enough; at least enough so to warrant being out of the negatives (which, at the time of writing, is now true).\n\nSadly, a significant number of redditors use the downvote as an \"I don't agree with you/like you\" button. Perfectly valid discussion can get buried because it doesn't align with a certain opinion, no matter how well written or researched it could be.\n\nQuite a few subreddits even disable the downvote, or at the very least have a message along the lines of \"Please only downvote off-topic posts and spam\". That's a different topic all together, but it exemplifies how bad it can sometimes get.\n\nAnd you're right, there's nothing I as a single person can do about it.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

I would cut off all arming of any sort to foreign nations.\n\nI'd invest in other forms of Energy and give big oil the boot and push for the EU and Allies to do the same hopefully cutting off major terrorist funding as a side effect.\n\nI'd get rid of the ATF, DEA, TSA, all these agencies that waste of government money, time, and don't cooperate and put one agency in charge of their duties. \n\nI'd revamp our education system and force idiotic ideologies like creationism and abstinence out.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.
