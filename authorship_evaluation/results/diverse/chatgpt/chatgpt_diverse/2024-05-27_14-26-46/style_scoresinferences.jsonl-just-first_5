Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control.

I'd downsize the military and cut spending, give the middle finger to the Middle East and tell them to fix their own problems and if they don't like it I'll just install a new government. I would cut off all arming of any sort to foreign nations.\n\nI'd invest in other forms of Energy and give big oil the boot and push for the EU and Allies to do the same hopefully cutting off major terrorist funding as a side effect.\n\nI'd get rid of the ATF, DEA, TSA, all these agencies that waste of government money, time, and don't cooperate and put one agency in charge of their duties. \n\nI'd revamp our education system and force idiotic ideologies like creationism and abstinence out.

To own guns in general, a one-time very thorough background check with a 5 year checkup and a firearms safety course. Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control.

(As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control.

The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

I'd downsize the military and cut spending, give the middle finger to the Middle East and tell them to fix their own problems and if they don't like it I'll just install a new government. I would cut off all arming of any sort to foreign nations.\n\nI'd invest in other forms of Energy and give big oil the boot and push for the EU and Allies to do the same hopefully cutting off major terrorist funding as a side effect.\n\nI'd get rid of the ATF, DEA, TSA, all these agencies that waste of government money, time, and don't cooperate and put one agency in charge of their duties. \n\nI'd revamp our education system and force idiotic ideologies like creationism and abstinence out. I would try to build a nation based on merit. No religious interference in the government. I'd attempt to get rid of this idea that all kids are special and everyone gets rewards. Competition is healthy. (Except for me as supreme leader lol)\n\nI'd get rid of the National Firearms act and allow concealed carry across the nation as long as a thorough training course is taken and the individuals keep train and enforce safety standards. To own guns in general, a one-time very thorough background check with a 5 year checkup and a firearms safety course. Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason. Taking safety and operation courses is essential as well.\n\nThis is an ongoing list.", "Not according to the know it all I just went on a date with.

That seems very unlikely.\n\nThere are [many states that have adopted English as their official language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_United_States), but it's also important to understand that they're not very strong laws.  They're *English official laws*, not English only laws.  We have had states try English only laws, but [they've failed supreme court challenges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meyer_v._Nebraska).  At best, all the English official laws do is require that state-produced materials and documents -- from marriage licenses to fishing licenses to state tax documents -- must appear in English.  However, I've lived in an English official state (Arizona) and I'm absolutely certain documents were presented in English and Spanish.  Denying someone government services because they don't speak English would almost certainly run into Due Process problems.\n\nSo the individual states *could* do it, but seeing as many have already adopted English official laws, and paired with the fact that English official laws don't have a huge amount of power means that is overall pretty unlikely.\n"], "target_texts": ["I wanna bang his ex-girlfriend.", "Thicker then a biscuit.", "He means the beard is doing worse  for you rather then doing good for you.", "anyone have the full source?", "Well if you believe [Google images](https://www.google.com/search?tbs=sbi:AMhZZiuSwHzpofYfXZX7JkUCQCHZSoT3Bui77MuwOvHNJBHIIoqgguQlSr-B8x-UmzFtk43_19WCVnY_1XWcfqZ4b1f9TQBSMKL6gRu6YlYSzMMukBSKh66qqGhO70H4kZhyNhvn982KpYjNzmzdAZ8PwzsoF002kembD5VBoAg53UU3RAtKD03v-sfk9sYTC5hwTrMc_1AWPufYjsYOGeDPGA2xtU_1SGV0DIlrDr_1sGoxQtgBTojavCy7hTFkPG4wdtuqCToU5x8Ogz1kxvL1Eyp4I5IKiEGMLLDT9cv4_1mOLdIXWcVGPtl4a8PVxmKs5kisEc09wDthv5hsbBlten06-6jWWL6tiAZ3Y3a7PkZFxHur6ubi2rC_1vi7cFf8PObdu3oNzaZ6ajdx4m9SrZFAWwqkd7YuGaRzPzsWcNh9_17qmsHgL48jMUYzCtxlmUHjswJULxXTJKUMxfoB32Ru4f0rsGDjmhtTTFQ7T-NHnTUCSKN2ulc5DLr5bsLK_1iyRVVokgmk7RUX_1ZMJPq_1yVIX3bNTF4vT_1ui2ETiG4dPVmx6m0a_1KPGdX2wSxZXaDTWO1juj0tGIpsZt1lw5VDfbJED2ulVQzEXdwGdFgRF5ly2UX0lEOqEI2EWWYzfNign5UKy1EuEEtfk84ezI6b-Wmd9ZTnJh_1ncOLZZf43cghtXu0qKhlCBiD2GVo1iK5hzS3CdeMeYhqALky2fWNz7fBKHlPrn-IJf1hU3F3alwk7vOIlQBZsMbKpyhTXs1pGqrIm1s5jZjbSHxIVnngrDsfjpqHoDipFtph4g8yye_16GiJjU2fmYW4Hr7y9HM3AN4A6tOorShiB2Q9ejhoh3lH7eEpvesvDSoU_1dIZByyAvriwNS2EcXRprujtvkdobnstPqFxJk7XwLgomojSwj1I1G8Ppo0IVWVI6NUrCNK0INR-4hjr4WCAXUoS2NUZJwLSfqz0D2cdb60QPmEVVLGjo_1p0a9YL-xDPUdGG-tkcjwEbP1_1t1T3e1R_1BVbvvRj4t7ewa3wI66LfBHiR-OJp5Z3eD5KjCvKrBYZ6vOxskZ59cjtJrQQZJ2qzx1PZEC1mwyJs-q1gTpArWiQGKP4leBQEN06NhoHUT-NXVcSDRxxrJaX02ogFhaUrbRWu3Gi08VOU5hElM51AVMDBpa2i2VIXb1VCkOz2g2kLAx3pEicOKR3b2y12B8BIZGPCi98v9QGCDTfvkkiqxmchSuS2QJa6sfGCMfXlJ9bp78RNfE_1iTJQOygl9G-yM0R2Jd7cnbRQDaZCdDX6VecZgJbJSqGaQ5-paqOgzJMIpxGCwYx-3kPky14qCHuenf1PFjtS9TEsGZRWfYswfSHuZwWQO5ZDVr9jHOM2YoQ-Lrs7E9q-k8A_1-gMK7e9EiYsaTCPfwb4pbiwz9LuUE4BxvLP1wM312lU2fYiGNRHuBD-i0bzIsEzu2JdZr1YgS8y3DEIRLNs968I7-Z90ro3lsnAN-lTkN15ISFtHJq2jtrsTFSj7B7plnIzUYt7TmqxHwofecBolPHRmOH94cux926TqQoHYVh2qjf8BoJz2EQ_1yYfFc1Sor2R2_1CS2Fe3JOFO2mDw8YuskY6GvOSkUhxJKUxCvEISDmFMyQarGmNG5dxiM18BRCxT2OqS9eJUpnLQxBybbAG0FhkFcWL&amp;width=640&amp;height=680) You just have to book her as a escort.\n\nEdit: Also check his other post history. https://www.reddit.com/user/Tommenn", "You're a idiot.", "Because she just don't care.", "The Guadeloupe in texas", "Same exact thing I do on the toilet!", "Downgrade your phone then go over to tmobile to switch carriers.

I thought that held too much water and resulted in rot and fungus anyway.\n\nSphagnum does hold a lot of water.

That seems very unlikely.\n\nThere are [many states that have adopted English as their official language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_United_States), but it's also important to understand that they're not very strong laws.  They're *English official laws*, not English only laws.  We have had states try English only laws, but [they've failed supreme court challenges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meyer_v._Nebraska).  At best, all the English official laws do is require that state-produced materials and documents -- from marriage licenses to fishing licenses to state tax documents -- must appear in English.  However, I've lived in an English official state (Arizona) and I'm absolutely certain documents were presented in English and Spanish.  Denying someone government services because they don't speak English would almost certainly run into Due Process problems.\n\nSo the individual states *could* do it, but seeing as many have already adopted English official laws, and paired with the fact that English official laws don't have a huge amount of power means that is overall pretty unlikely.\n"], "target_texts": ["/r/osha /r/fastworkers /r/watchpeopledie?", "Poor Garry Shandling.

They're *English official laws*, not English only laws.  We have had states try English only laws, but [they've failed supreme court challenges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meyer_v._Nebraska).  At best, all the English official laws do is require that state-produced materials and documents -- from marriage licenses to fishing licenses to state tax documents -- must appear in English.  However, I've lived in an English official state (Arizona) and I'm absolutely certain documents were presented in English and Spanish.  Denying someone government services because they don't speak English would almost certainly run into Due Process problems.\n\nSo the individual states *could* do it, but seeing as many have already adopted English official laws, and paired with the fact that English official laws don't have a huge amount of power means that is overall pretty unlikely.\n"], "target_texts": ["It's actually SciFi now.

It's only powerful when you can put in a large number of shuffle effects.  It's just that the card was printed in the same block as fetch lands and so -- outside of cube -- has never seen play without fetches.  JtMS without fetches is still good, but nowhere near as good.\n", "Eh.  He also believed Einstein was wrong and believed in eugenics.\n\nHe was a smart guy, but he was still human.\n", "Brainstorming the first time causes you to see 3 new cards... and brainstorm locks you.  Absent another effect, you see nothing new for 2 turns.\n\nSeriously, without fetches, Brainstorm is *not* a good card.  It's close to Serum Visions.\n", "&gt; Would it possible for United States of America to declare American English and Spanish as Official Languages?\n\nIt's doubtful the Federal Government could declare any official language.  The commerce clause does have limitations, one of which is the First Amendment, and trying to regulate commerce in the US to require English would almost certainly run afould of First Amendment challenges.  I can't think of any other authority under which it my be passed.  [General welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_welfare_clause)?  That seems very unlikely.\n\nThere are [many states that have adopted English as their official language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_United_States), but it's also important to understand that they're not very strong laws.  They're *English official laws*, not English only laws.  We have had states try English only laws, but [they've failed supreme court challenges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meyer_v._Nebraska).  At best, all the English official laws do is require that state-produced materials and documents -- from marriage licenses to fishing licenses to state tax documents -- must appear in English.  However, I've lived in an English official state (Arizona) and I'm absolutely certain documents were presented in English and Spanish.  Denying someone government services because they don't speak English would almost certainly run into Due Process problems.\n\nSo the individual states *could* do it, but seeing as many have already adopted English official laws, and paired with the fact that English official laws don't have a huge amount of power means that is overall pretty unlikely.\n"], "target_texts": ["So that's what having X-ray vision kick in must be like.", "Are they bringing Neil Patrick Harris in as the Music Meister?", "Fired seems to be the best case scenario in what these cops will get you.", "Depends...

To own guns in general, a one-time very thorough background check with a 5 year checkup and a firearms safety course. Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason. Taking safety and operation courses is essential as well.\n\nThis is an ongoing list.", "Not according to the know it all I just went on a date with.

There are other options, too- including pure sphagnum, and Hydroton (hydroponics store) works if nothing else does.\n\nPics would help a lot.", "&gt;s sphagnum that much more resistant to rot/fungus then that I should just go straight sphagnum? I thought that held too much water and resulted in rot and fungus anyway.\n\nSphagnum does hold a lot of water. The trick is to water/fertilize only lightly (80% of the time), and then once every 4-5-6 waterings flush the hell out of it with nice, clean water- no fertilizer. That way, it's only really *wet* a small portion of the time. Clear pots really help with this.\n\n&gt;I was using bark from weathered oak logs in the yard. \n\nYeah, you need to buy the stuff for orchids.

I would cut off all arming of any sort to foreign nations.\n\nI'd invest in other forms of Energy and give big oil the boot and push for the EU and Allies to do the same hopefully cutting off major terrorist funding as a side effect.\n\nI'd get rid of the ATF, DEA, TSA, all these agencies that waste of government money, time, and don't cooperate and put one agency in charge of their duties. \n\nI'd revamp our education system and force idiotic ideologies like creationism and abstinence out.

To own guns in general, a one-time very thorough background check with a 5 year checkup and a firearms safety course. Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason. Taking safety and operation courses is essential as well.\n\nThis is an ongoing list.", "Not according to the know it all I just went on a date with.
