Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

I would cut off all arming of any sort to foreign nations.\n\nI'd invest in other forms of Energy and give big oil the boot and push for the EU and Allies to do the same hopefully cutting off major terrorist funding as a side effect.\n\nI'd get rid of the ATF, DEA, TSA, all these agencies that waste of government money, time, and don't cooperate and put one agency in charge of their duties. \n\nI'd revamp our education system and force idiotic ideologies like creationism and abstinence out. I would try to build a nation based on merit. No religious interference in the government. I'd attempt to get rid of this idea that all kids are special and everyone gets rewards. Competition is healthy. (Except for me as supreme leader lol)\n\nI'd get rid of the National Firearms act and allow concealed carry across the nation as long as a thorough training course is taken and the individuals keep train and enforce safety standards. To own guns in general, a one-time very thorough background check with a 5 year checkup and a firearms safety course. Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason. Taking safety and operation courses is essential as well.\n\nThis is an ongoing list.", "Not according to the know it all I just went on a date with.

I'd downsize the military and cut spending, give the middle finger to the Middle East and tell them to fix their own problems and if they don't like it I'll just install a new government. I would cut off all arming of any sort to foreign nations.\n\nI'd invest in other forms of Energy and give big oil the boot and push for the EU and Allies to do the same hopefully cutting off major terrorist funding as a side effect.\n\nI'd get rid of the ATF, DEA, TSA, all these agencies that waste of government money, time, and don't cooperate and put one agency in charge of their duties. \n\nI'd revamp our education system and force idiotic ideologies like creationism and abstinence out. I would try to build a nation based on merit. No religious interference in the government. I'd attempt to get rid of this idea that all kids are special and everyone gets rewards. Competition is healthy. (Except for me as supreme leader lol)\n\nI'd get rid of the National Firearms act and allow concealed carry across the nation as long as a thorough training course is taken and the individuals keep train and enforce safety standards. To own guns in general, a one-time very thorough background check with a 5 year checkup and a firearms safety course. Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason. Taking safety and operation courses is essential as well.\n\nThis is an ongoing list.", "Not according to the know it all I just went on a date with.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control.

Even if they're not alive, a few dead roots don't hurt all that much.\n\nWhere are you getting your bark from? Good bark is hard to find these days. There are other options, too- including pure sphagnum, and Hydroton (hydroponics store) works if nothing else does.\n\nPics would help a lot.", "&gt;s sphagnum that much more resistant to rot/fungus then that I should just go straight sphagnum? I thought that held too much water and resulted in rot and fungus anyway.\n\nSphagnum does hold a lot of water. The trick is to water/fertilize only lightly (80% of the time), and then once every 4-5-6 waterings flush the hell out of it with nice, clean water- no fertilizer. That way, it's only really *wet* a small portion of the time. Clear pots really help with this.\n\n&gt;I was using bark from weathered oak logs in the yard. \n\nYeah, you need to buy the stuff for orchids.

How well that translates to humans is yet to be seen.\n\nHowever, we know that in some instances, antibiotics can get rid of H. pylori, an organism known to cause stomach ulcers- even antibiotics taken for reasons other than ulcers can do this.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control.

Proper reddiquette advises using downvotes for comments that don't contribute to the discussion, and in my opinion, a light-hearted comment like his does contribute enough; at least enough to deserve being in positive territory (which, as of now, is the case).

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

I'd downsize the military and cut spending, give the middle finger to the Middle East and tell them to fix their own problems, and if they don't like it, I'll just install a new government. I would cut off all arming of any sort to foreign nations. I'd invest in other forms of Energy and give big oil the boot and push for the EU and Allies to do the same, hopefully cutting off major terrorist funding as a side effect. I'd revamp our education system and force idiotic ideologies like creationism and abstinence out. I would try to build a nation based on merit. No religious interference in the government. I'd attempt to get rid of this idea that all kids are special and everyone gets rewards. Competition is healthy. (Except for me as supreme leader lol) I'd get rid of the National Firearms Act and allow concealed carry across the nation as long as a thorough training course is taken and the individuals keep train and enforce safety standards. To own guns in general, a one-time very thorough background check with a 5-year checkup and a firearms safety course. Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi-autos, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi-autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

He's probably more reasonably-priced than many vets.\n\nThere are no bargains to be had, but a crusty old vet that's been there, done that, and has no vet school debt to pay is going to cost less than a whippersnapper who needs to send every biopsy sample to pathology even though if that spot *is* a tiny dermal hemangiosarcoma, it's not going to be treated any different than if it's excised and cauterized. (Up-the-street vet cost estimate: $750. Yocham quoted me $95, used a local instead of general anesthesia.)", "Any chance you can just get by without the belt winding around the a/c? When it happened with mine, it didn't take out any wires, so I just got the smaller belt that leaves out the a/c compressor and the power steering.

If the bark hasn't been treated right first, the organisms that make it fuzzy are ubiquitous, and their spores will land on it and make it moldy.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, I had neglected to aggressively cut the roots, not really being sure how to tell what was dead or not.\n\nYou tug on them, and if they fall apart like in segments, they're good and dead. Even if they're not alive, a few dead roots don't hurt all that much.\n\nWhere are you getting your bark from? Good bark is hard to find these days. There are other options, too- including pure sphagnum, and Hydroton (hydroponics store) works if nothing else does.\n\nPics would help a lot.", "&gt;s sphagnum that much more resistant to rot/fungus then that I should just go straight sphagnum? I thought that held too much water and resulted in rot and fungus anyway.\n\nSphagnum does hold a lot of water. The trick is to water/fertilize only lightly (80% of the time), and then once every 4-5-6 waterings flush the hell out of it with nice, clean water- no fertilizer. That way, it's only really *wet* a small portion of the time.

(As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason. Taking safety and operation courses is essential as well.\n\nThis is an ongoing list.", "Bot! Beep beep!

(As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.
