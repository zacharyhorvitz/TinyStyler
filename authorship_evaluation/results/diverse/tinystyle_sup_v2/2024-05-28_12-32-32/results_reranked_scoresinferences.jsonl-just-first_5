Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

To own guns in general, a one-time very thorough background check with a 5 year checkup and a firearms safety course. Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

If the bark hasn't been treated right first, the organisms that make it fuzzy are ubiquitous, and their spores will land on it and make it moldy.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, I had neglected to aggressively cut the roots, not really being sure how to tell what was dead or not.\n\nYou tug on them, and if they fall apart like in segments, they're good and dead. Even if they're not alive, a few dead roots don't hurt all that much.\n\nWhere are you getting your bark from? Good bark is hard to find these days.

That way, it's only really *wet* a small portion of the time.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

(As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason. Taking safety and operation courses is essential as well.\n\nThis is an ongoing list.", "Not according to the know it all I just went on a date with.

I would cut off all arming of any sort to foreign nations.\n\nI'd invest in other forms of Energy and give big oil the boot and push for the EU and Allies to do the same hopefully cutting off major terrorist funding as a side effect.\n\nI'd get rid of the ATF, DEA, TSA, all these agencies that waste of government money, time, and don't cooperate and put one agency in charge of their duties. \n\nI'd revamp our education system and force idiotic ideologies like creationism and abstinence out.

To own guns in general, a one-time very thorough background check with a 5 year checkup and a firearms safety course. Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason. Taking safety and operation courses is essential as well.\n\nThis is an ongoing list.", "Not according to the know it all I just went on a date with.

I would cut off all arming of any sort to foreign nations.\n\nI'd invest in other forms of Energy and give big oil the boot and push for the EU and Allies to do the same hopefully cutting off major terrorist funding as a side effect.\n\nI'd get rid of the ATF, DEA, TSA, all these agencies that waste of government money, time, and don't cooperate and put one agency in charge of their duties. \n\nI'd revamp our education system and force idiotic ideologies like creationism and abstinence out.

To own guns in general, a one-time very thorough background check with a 5 year checkup and a firearms safety course. Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

I would cut off all arming of any sort to foreign nations.\n\nI'd invest in other forms of Energy and give big oil the boot and push for the EU and Allies to do the same hopefully cutting off major terrorist funding as a side effect.\n\nI'd get rid of the ATF, DEA, TSA, all these agencies that waste of government money, time, and don't cooperate and put one agency in charge of their duties. \n\nI'd revamp our education system and force idiotic ideologies like creationism and abstinence out.

To own guns in general, a one-time very thorough background check with a 5 year checkup and a firearms safety course. Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

That seems very unlikely.\n\nThere are [many states that have adopted English as their official language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_United_States), but it's also important to understand that they're not very strong laws.  They're *English official laws*, not English only laws.  We have had states try English only laws, but [they've failed supreme court challenges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meyer_v._Nebraska).  At best, all the English official laws do is require that state-produced materials and documents -- from marriage licenses to fishing licenses to state tax documents -- must appear in English.  However, I've lived in an English official state (Arizona) and I'm absolutely certain documents were presented in English and Spanish.  Denying someone government services because they don't speak English would almost certainly run into Due Process problems.\n\nSo the individual states *could* do it, but seeing as many have already adopted English official laws, and paired with the fact that English official laws don't have a huge amount of power means that is overall pretty unlikely.\n"], "target_texts": ["This should come preinstalled in all college student housing.", "You don't have to be male to be into chicks.", "That was my first thought.", "Pok\u00e9mon is the type of game where a comprehensive guide of the game mechanics is pretty useful, though.", "I see what you did there.\n\nThat was intentional, right?", "Yeah.

I can't think of any other authority under which it my be passed.  [General welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_welfare_clause)?  That seems very unlikely.\n\nThere are [many states that have adopted English as their official language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_United_States), but it's also important to understand that they're not very strong laws.  They're *English official laws*, not English only laws.  We have had states try English only laws, but [they've failed supreme court challenges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meyer_v._Nebraska).  At best, all the English official laws do is require that state-produced materials and documents -- from marriage licenses to fishing licenses to state tax documents -- must appear in English.  However, I've lived in an English official state (Arizona) and I'm absolutely certain documents were presented in English and Spanish.  Denying someone government services because they don't speak English would almost certainly run into Due Process problems.\n\nSo the individual states *could* do it, but seeing as many have already adopted English official laws, and paired with the fact that English official laws don't have a huge amount of power means that is overall pretty unlikely.\n"], "target_texts": ["Yocham at [Southside Animal Hospital](http://ssahvets.com/) was pretty good in terms of prices, but he retired and the practice is now owned by Tascon.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

I'd downsize the military and cut spending, give the middle finger to the Middle East and tell them to fix their own problems and if they don't like it I'll just install a new government. I would cut off all arming of any sort to foreign nations.\n\nI'd invest in other forms of Energy and give big oil the boot and push for the EU and Allies to do the same hopefully cutting off major terrorist funding as a side effect.\n\nI'd get rid of the ATF, DEA, TSA, all these agencies that waste of government money, time, and don't cooperate and put one agency in charge of their duties. \n\nI'd revamp our education system and force idiotic ideologies like creationism and abstinence out. I would try to build a nation based on merit. No religious interference in the government. I'd attempt to get rid of this idea that all kids are special and everyone gets rewards. Competition is healthy.

To own guns in general, a one-time very thorough background check with a 5 year checkup and a firearms safety course. Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason. Taking safety and operation courses is essential as well.\n\nThis is an ongoing list.", "Not according to the know it all I just went on a date with.

The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.
