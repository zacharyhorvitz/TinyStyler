Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control.

I'd downsize the military and cut spending, give the middle finger to the Middle East and tell them to fix their own problems and if they don't like it I'll just install a new government. I would cut off all arming of any sort to foreign nations.\n\nI'd invest in other forms of Energy and give big oil the boot and push for the EU and Allies to do the same hopefully cutting off major terrorist funding as a side effect.\n\nI'd get rid of the ATF, DEA, TSA, all these agencies that waste of government money, time, and don't cooperate and put one agency in charge of their duties. \n\nI'd revamp our education system and force idiotic ideologies like creationism and abstinence out.

To own guns in general, a one-time very thorough background check with a 5 year checkup and a firearms safety course. Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason. Taking safety and operation courses is essential as well.\n\nThis is an ongoing list.", "Not according to the know it all I just went on a date with.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

I would cut off all arming of any sort to foreign nations.\n\nI'd invest in other forms of Energy and give big oil the boot and push for the EU and Allies to do the same hopefully cutting off major terrorist funding as a side effect.\n\nI'd get rid of the ATF, DEA, TSA, all these agencies that waste of government money, time, and don't cooperate and put one agency in charge of their duties. \n\nI'd revamp our education system and force idiotic ideologies like creationism and abstinence out.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

I would cut off all arming of any sort to foreign nations.\n\nI'd invest in other forms of Energy and give big oil the boot and push for the EU and Allies to do the same hopefully cutting off major terrorist funding as a side effect.\n\nI'd get rid of the ATF, DEA, TSA, all these agencies that waste of government money, time, and don't cooperate and put one agency in charge of their duties. \n\nI'd revamp our education system and force idiotic ideologies like creationism and abstinence out.

To own guns in general, a one-time very thorough background check with a 5 year checkup and a firearms safety course. Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason.

(As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason. Taking safety and operation courses is essential as well.\n\nThis is an ongoing list.", "Not according to the know it all I just went on a date with.

I'd downsize the military and cut spending, give the middle finger to the Middle East and tell them to fix their own problems and if they don't like it I'll just install a new government. I would cut off all arming of any sort to foreign nations.\n\nI'd invest in other forms of Energy and give big oil the boot and push for the EU and Allies to do the same hopefully cutting off major terrorist funding as a side effect.\n\nI'd get rid of the ATF, DEA, TSA, all these agencies that waste of government money, time, and don't cooperate and put one agency in charge of their duties. \n\nI'd revamp our education system and force idiotic ideologies like creationism and abstinence out. I would try to build a nation based on merit. No religious interference in the government. I'd attempt to get rid of this idea that all kids are special and everyone gets rewards. Competition is healthy. (Except for me as supreme leader lol)\n\nI'd get rid of the National Firearms act and allow concealed carry across the nation as long as a thorough training course is taken and the individuals keep train and enforce safety standards. To own guns in general, a one-time very thorough background check with a 5 year checkup and a firearms safety course. Upon clearing a background check, you receive a firearms operator license and for each \"tier\" the card is updated. To own semi auto's, you simply take a safety course which includes range time. (As an alternative, I thought of changing this to hunting weapons just being a simple background check like it is now and a thorough one for semi autos, but keep in mind there are no bans on any weapons or accessories.) The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control. Basically, it massively expands background checks but also allows for anyone qualified enough to own and operate whatever they want within reason. Taking safety and operation courses is essential as well.\n\nThis is an ongoing list.", "Not according to the know it all I just went on a date with.

The basic premise for this is a compromise for current laws and the push for gun control.
