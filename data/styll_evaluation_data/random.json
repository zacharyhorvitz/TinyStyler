You ask why you should bother. And I say because this is a debate forum.\n\nThat's not a good reason to bother. \n\n&gt; Just because there must be at least one thing that everything else is 'moved by' doesn't mean that all of those things are 'contained' in the first thing.\n\nIt does in this case. \n\n&gt; That's not an argument that is proven correct by my acceptance that a thing's existence can be explained by nothing. That's just an opinion that you happen to hold.\n\nAnd you objected, saying you believe something like the PSR. \n\n&gt; This again. Why are you pretending to have not seen the words that I have written?\n\nI'm not, I'm well aware of what you've written. \n\n&gt; \"I view 'Internal explanations' as an attempt to maintain that you haven't thrown out the principle of sufficient reason, when in reality that's exactly what you've done.\"\n\nThis view is very silly, but also entirely irrelevant. \n\n&gt; \" I think they're equivalent. Meaning I think \"internal causation\" actually means \"no causation\". Other people, like you, obviously do not share my view. You think that internal causation is somehow distinct from no causation.\"\n\nSo you accept that \"internal causation\" means \"no causation\" and \"no causation\" means \"internal causation\"?\n\nIn which case, you'd accept the claim \"Everything that exists either has an external explanation or an internal explanation\". \n\nWhich is the PSR. So now you accept the PSR. Hence the contradiction. ", "Then you need some more premises to justify the use of science. It doesn't follow from your premises that science is a good way to learn about the universe.

And  you didn't respond to my objection. \n\n&gt; 4th bullet point: I am assuming most people do not think they deserve in eternity in agonizing torment for finite sins, that is my argument\n\nWhy should I care what most people think? In my experience, most Christians believe they *do* deserve hell. \n\n&gt; 3rd bullet point: The Bible states that sin is a transgression of the law, the Torah was the law, therefore, sin is breaking the Torah law, that is my argument\n\nYou didn't provide this justification earlier, and either way it's bad. It's not convincing. Because it's false. \n\n&gt; 2nd bullet point: in my opinion, not all people deserve death, why? I don't know, why do you think, it's my opinion, I have no argument other than this is my personal opinion\n\n&gt; 1st bullet point: also my personal opinion\n\nAnd why should I care at all about what your opinion is? Arguing isn't about informing people about your opinion. Arguing is about *justifying your views*. If you are incapable of justifying any view you have, you should not have it. If you are incapable of justifying these opinions, then you should abandon them. You have no reason to think they are true.\n\nSo it boils down to this: feelings are not good evidence. You need real justification for your belief. \n\nOr I guess you can just not care if you're wrong. I can't make you care about that.

I don't have to prove the opposite of what you're saying, all I have to do is point out you haven't justified your claims. What has been presented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. \n\n&gt; I said before \"if you believe in the Bible, and you believe that a sin is a transgression of the law, and if you believe God gave the law to Moses, and if you don't follow the Torah, you are a sinner because you are breaking the law\" \n\nThat's a very different claim. That's a conditional claim. And it's true, *if* I believed that I'd accept the conclusion. \n\n&gt; You shouldn't care about what my opinion is. However, when arguing religion, something that can't be proven,\n\nNow here's the issue. I hold that claims about religion *can* be proven. Obviously. If I didn't believe that, why would I hold any opinions about religion?\n\n&gt; But so far every single time I state my belief and why I believe it, you literally just say \"you didn't justify it.\" How else can I justify my beliefs without explaining them? Explaining my beliefs is justifying them\n\nNo, it is not. I could go into extravagant detail about how the Earth is hollow and Nazis live there who are planning on destroying the moon, but explaining *what* I believe doesn't get us any closer to those beliefs being justified.\n\nI understand *what* you believe, I just don't think there's any good reason to believe it. And you haven't given one. \n\n&gt;  I'm done with this argument because it is literally going nowhere, it's literally just me explaining my beliefs, and you going \"justify them\" than me trying to justify them, and then you ignoring what I said by saying \"don't explain, justify\" without realizing I can't justify without explaining my beliefs.\n\nYou've explained your beliefs plenty. I understand  them. That is not the issue. The issue is that I do not agree. Which means you need to justify.

And you're correct that states may not be more restrictive with that liberty. But they can certainly be more permissive. SCOTUS created a floor, not a ceiling. SCOTUS has traditionally been deferential to state sovereignty. Moreover, SCOTUS is compelled to make sure a right is 'meaningful.' This means it cannot define \"arms\" is such a way so as to render the right meaningless. \n\nWhat will likely happen is that SCOTUS will draw from the 1A's time/place/manner restriction (maybe with a dash of *Miller*) and forge an analogy to the *Katz* framework. So states will be free to regulate the type of \"arms\" a person may own in light of what their society is prepared to accept as reasonable ownership. At the outset this would probably exclude weapons used in sustained warfare such as heavy infantry arms, WMDs, RPGs. But it would also provide a floor such that a state (I'm looking at you California) couldn't render the 2A meaningless by stating only single shot .22 caliber rifles of 42\" of length can be owned by the average citizen. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, some states are *desperate* for SCOTUS standards. California does not have a 2A equivalent and circuit interpretation here has been vexing. ", "\"They can't go more permissive then Congress\"\n\nBut, ostensibly, *Heller* threw congressional regulation up for review. ", "I'm aware of the supremacy clause. Ostensibly *Heller* put many of those federal regulations up for review, right? As such SCOTUS created a floor but no ceiling.  Many regulations must meet scrutiny now. Or am I wrong about that? \n\nYour logic would lead to results that could render the 2A meaningless. States have shown time and again that they cannot be trusted with minimum supervision. IMO it was proper to incorporate the 2A against the states. I think we need some minimum guidance.  California is proof of what happens when we don't. I don't disagree that each state should have a heavy hand in deciding gun policies for themselves.  But the complications between state and federal law in this area is dangerous to the average person. Amd I think we all deserve some simplicity and minimal standardization here.\n\nEdit.
